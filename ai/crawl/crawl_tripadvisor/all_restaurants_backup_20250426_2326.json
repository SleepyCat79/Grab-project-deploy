      "This rooftop laundry shop in District 1, right across from Bitexco Tower, is a hidden gem. It’s a simple but smart idea — do your laundry while enjoying a great cup of coffee and a beautiful city view. The prices are fair, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The coffee is smooth and delicious, whether you like it strong or creamy. It’s more than just a place to wash clothes — it turns a boring chore into a relaxing experience. If you’re in the area, it’s definitely worth a visit.",

      "Traditional looking restaurant in a courtyard of restaurants and cafés up an alleyway opposite the Ben Than Market ( north side - Le Thanh Ton Street) and claiming to (and probably is) serving home cooking style meals. Varied though complicated menu - specialist noodle dishes (on a separate menu) are brought in from the place next door - complicate things if you want to pay by credit card. (No fee if you pay by credit card just for food and drink off the restaurants own menu.). Very tasty food, prompt and helpful service. We sat downstairs on long tables, so other diners next to us, as the upstairs seemed airless - without a balcony or window. Breath of salad range and vegetarian options seem limited. Some dishes, like snakehead fish we have not seen elsewhere. Good value – means 100-240k approx, sides about 30k. We spent about 450k between the two of us.",
      "This restaurant was recommended by our guide when we first arrived in Saigon. We went there on our first evening, and then back again for lunch on our final day. It is situated down a narrow alleyway but we found it easily with the instructions given by our guide. (He mentioned that this was his 'go to' restaurant when he was going for a meal with friends.) The restaurant is small and you will generally have to share one of the long tables with other people. You may also need to wait to be seated, though on both occasions the wait was no more than ten minutes (after initially being told that it could be half an hour). However, it is worth it as the food is very good, albeit a bit more expensive than in some other establishments. (And note that the menu price does not include tax which adds 8% to the bill.)",
      "Located down a small street near Ben Thanh Market in Ho Chi Minh City, Bếp Mẹ Ỉn (which translates to “Mom’s Kitchen”) is a hidden gem. Here’s why you should consider dining here: Tasty Vietnamese Flavors: Bếp Mẹ Ỉn serves up authentic Vietnamese cuisine that bursts with flavor. From deep-fried tofu with impeccably crispy exteriors to succulent grilled chicken legs, your taste buds are in for a treat. Fantastic Price Value: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly meal without compromising on quality, this is the place. Bếp Mẹ Ỉn offers a wide variety of dishes at wallet-friendly prices. Friendly Staff: The staff here are warm, friendly, and attentive. Whether you’re a local or a traveler, they’ll make you feel right at home. Refreshing Drinks and Desserts: Pair your meal with interesting and refreshing drinks. And don’t forget to explore their dessert options—they’re delightful! Pro Tip: Try the Grilled Chicken Leg with Chilli Salt and thank me later! Remember, this review is based on available sources, so if you get a chance to visit Bếp Mẹ Ỉn yourself, share your personal experience with others!"

The staffs are all really nice and they make your dininng time feel heartwarm. In particular, Alex was hearty in showing the way, Kayla is an excellent bartender who caters for her guests in a very active, friendly way. I am also especially impressed at Francis for his food knowledge, his friendliness and engagement when serving his customers.

Totally deserving of the Michelin stars he got! Made our anniversary an unforgettable memory!",

      "Saigon has countless restaurants on high floors, but from this one you not only have great views, but also a culinary experience of the highest standard. The truffle mushroom soup was a poem, the fish each exquisite and refined and the service beyond any doubt. We have been to one of the “sister restaurants” in Hoi An twice before and were fully enthusiastic here as well. Prices are slightly higher for the country level, of course, but in all Western countries you would probably pay double for dinner at this level. Accordingly, a fair deal for visitors to the city with high standards of cuisine.",
      "Cloud Nine is a real rare gem! Upon arrival, we were greeted with elegance and great courtesy. The service is impeccable, attentive without being intrusive. Each dish was a work of art, combining creativity, finesse and exquisite flavours. The atmosphere of the restaurant is simply mesmerizing: dim light, soft music, and a refined decoration that invites relaxation. Perfect for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. We spent a moment suspended out of time. An unmissable address for lovers of fine dining!",
      "We came here for our last dinner before leaving Vietnam after a 3 week trip. We chose from the a la carte, their spring rolls were the best we’ve had and we were recommended the fillet steaks which were flamboyantly finished off by our table with flames. We have eaten Vietnamese every day of our holiday so far but although a western dish it had a Vietnamese twist. Staff were attentive and friendly. Views spectacular. Highly recommended for a special meal."

      "We had an amazing dinner at the unique Vietnamese restaurant - based on home cooked food and occupying two homes across the street from each other. You are escorted upstairs to the table and a sumptuous feast followed - in fact a little too much. One specialty is deep fried tofu which we had been told about but to our tastes it was still like tasteless tofu, sadly. The remainder of the meal was excellent however and the service first rate, the ambience was very attractive and we would recommend this restaurant. It is a bit of a way off the main Saigon CBD so you will need transport, we had it all pre-booked. There is a modest wine list and the meal washed down with a good white wine was very enjoyable.",
      "The feel was superb from beginning to end. We’ve been traveling around Vietnam for 2 weeks and this was by far our favorite meal. We ordered an ungodly amount of food because we just couldn’t decide what to pick. My number one choice was the soft shell crab recommended by our waitress. We also loved the ginger chicken, the shrimp and bacon (more like pork belly)(incredible), papaya salad, pomelo salad with shrimp and pork, spring rolls, coconut smoothie, orange smoothie, Tom Collins cocktail, Good Morning Vietnam cocktail (the only thing that didn’t wow me), the fruit platter for dessert, and the herbal jelly. Every bite is flavorful and well presented. The building is interesting and homey. The service was great and the food came out quickly. We loved it! Thanks for a great dinner!"

The baguettes are very good and don't have liver pate on them, which was nice after all these days. The chicken was cut into slices and therefore not so dry and the vegetables were fresh. The Banh Mi here aren't exactly cheap though. One costs between 60,000 and 80,000 dong. The service was very friendly and we also got a free friendship bracelet that is supposed to bring us luck.",
      "These were the first bahn mi of this trip and they did not disappoint the bread was fresh and crispy and the filling’s plentiful, I had roast pork and hubby had the special, we also had a coke and a mango smoothie which was so refreshing, all this for 190000 dong, being given the beautiful charm bracelet at the end is very special and a lovely momento of our trip. The lady who served us was so lovely. Tip- on the back of the menu they have things like how much chilli, coriander or no coriander and many more options so it makes ordering so easy.",
      "Banh Mi very good and very rich! The ingredients are all fresh. Prices more than fair for sitting with air conditioning and soft drinks. The staff is very nice, it also says that if you don’t like Banh Mi at first bite you can say it and change it without problems."

      "Phở Việt Nam - Phạm Hồng Thái is a popular spot in Ho Chi Minh City, known for its rich, flavorful broth and fresh, house-made noodles. Their phở thố đá (served in a hot stone bowl) keeps the soup warm till the last bite. With fast service and a clean, bustling atmosphere, it’s a great choice for authentic Vietnamese phở. Michelin Guide-approved!",
      "Whow what an amazing restaurant & soo cheap. We had their best seller in the sizzling pho, the staff were super friendly and showed us how to make the sauces to go with it. The herbs ect to accompany the dish were fresh and well presented. There was heaps of beef in the soup and they make their noodles fresh onsite. It was busy, we weren’t rushed, it was clean, but mostly the food was soo delicious. We had a great experience here and if we had more time would have gone back. So worth finding this restaurant to have their Michelin Star Pho. Thank you for an enjoyable meal."

      "You shouldn't actually write a review so that it remains an insider tip, but this bar has to be reviewed. The location is in the south center of Saigon and we would always (again) take a taxi to and from the bar in the evening. There is a security guard in front of the apartment building (who also hails a taxi) and only a relatively small sign points to the bar, which you then reach by elevator from the lobby. And then? Wow, good music from various DJs (maybe a bit too loud, you still want to talk), nice people and good drinks of all kinds. We had a few drinks with friends, cocktails, draft beer, soft drinks and juices, everything was great. We were there for many hours and more than enjoyed it! The hamburgers are particularly worth mentioning and outstanding. You should be careful with superlatives, but these hamburgers are really world class! In addition, you sit or dance on a roof terrace with a great view of Saigon, the service is very friendly and quick and everything is affordable. You should definitely go! Crystal clear recommendation!",
      "Awesome vibes, excellent service, friendly vibe and top notch management. Emily will teach you card games, and has fantastic drink recommendations. The staff kept me company while I waited for my friends, ask them about the burgers, the menus, the after parties 🎉 Highly recommended."

      "We always aim for a Sunday Brunch in our travels. We were staying at the hotel so booked into the brunch here. Upon arrival we were met by an enthusiastic staff member who showed us to our table. Our brunch included free flow drinks. There was a choice of four cocktails but I asked if it was possible to have another one and it was not a problem. The beer and wine were cold and readily available if you wished. The food was great - oysters, crab, prawns, lobster, lamb, beef, fish, sushi, salads, dessert, cheeses - and the list goes on. It was an excellent choice of food and no shortage. The two staff members who looked after us were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. It is a great people watching venue. There was a real mixture of people - resident expats in groups, local couples enjoying a day out, groups of friends, mixed ages but all enjoying the afternoon. There was a DJ who played a good range of music. The only thing we didn't like was guys wearing singlets and flip flops. This is a fine dining restaurant. If there is one thing the hotel can do, it is to set and maintain a minimum standard and this should apply to dress. Apart from that, the brunch is worth a shot.",
      "I went here for dinner by myself and Lan Linh F&B server was sooo friendly and supportive taking so many beautiful photos for me as I was here by myself to enjoy. I enjoyed the dinner and the pretty photos of me that she took for me I’m very happy. Thanks Linh! I’ll be back again.",
      "I visited the social club on 6 Nov for my late dinner. An energetic young man Nhan Bui greeted me with a big smile and addressed me to a window seat with a very nice view. He is not only very knowledgeable on what they can offer and also have the patience to identify what s the best solution/food which I might need. What I observed is that he is a very hard working staff, he always serve and clean my table at the right time. I believe it required a very good attention on the customers. Every step he made can let you to feel his passion on serving customers. Overall, food quality met the expectation while the services far exceed. Special thanks to him and his team mates for their kind and responsive services. And most of your team members can speak fluent English. It is really a distinguished competitive edge in the market. 11月6日，我参观了社交俱乐部，吃了一顿很晚的晚餐。一个精力充沛的年轻人Nhan Bui微笑着迎接我，并把我对着一个可以看到美景的靠窗座位。他不仅非常了解他们可以提供什么，而且有耐心确定我可能需要的最佳解决方案/食物。我观察到的是，他是一个非常勤奋的员工，他总是在正确的时间服务和打扫我的桌子。我相信这需要非常关注客户。他迈出的每一步都能让你感受到他对为客户服务的热情。 总体而言，食品质量达到了预期，而服务远远超过预期。特别感谢他和他的队友们的友好和反应灵敏的服务。你的大多数团队成员都能说一口流利的英语。这确实是市场上一个突出的竞争优势。 强烈推荐。"

      "Today I went to meet a friend at Cafe Marcel. Stepping from a busy street I was instantly greeted by friendly staff and a relaxing environment. As it was my first time going there, the server politely explained both the food and drink menu and allowed me time to make my choices. I was promptly given my drink and without being rushed given a generous plate of food. The house made sausages had the perfect level of spice and my eggs were perfect for dipping the crunchy sourdough toast. All in all I can not recommend this place enough. Great addition to Saigon if you’re looking for a meeting point or delicious, fresh breakfast!",

The first time we went we were served by giang and the second time by phuong both were really lovely and helpful explaining the breakfast menu which is great value by the way. You can choose your eggs then your bread and sauce etc, they also have a really good brunch deal. The portions were really big and the food and iced coffee was so so good, would highly reccommend!",
      "This little cafe popped up in the search when we were looking for a flavorful meal on our last day in HCMC and it didn't disappoint. This is a tiny little cafe with seating on the first floor. Interiors are beautifully done and the staff is very courteous. Food items we had were Spicy Shakshuka, avocado tartine & iced phin coffee. Shakshuka wasn't very spicy, just the right amount for beautiful flavors. Avocado tartine was full of fresh avocado mash and cheese. And the coffee was just the right companion to top the entire meal. I would say it's the perfect place for breakfast/brunch. Prices are a little high as compared to other food options in the vicinity - but absolutely worth it..."

A special surprise was the clear vegetable soup we got unsolicited – a very nice gesture that reinforced the positive impression. 👨‍🍳 Service – 5 stars The service was exemplary! Our waiter from the team was extremely attentive and spoke very good English. Particularly positive: Not only did he give us expert recommendations, but he also repeated the order to make sure everything fits. That's what you'd like! 🧼 Cleanliness – 5 stars The restaurant was spotlessly clean – both the floor and tables were in perfect condition. Here you can see that great importance is attached to hygiene. 🚻 Toilets – 5 stars The toilets were modern and also extremely clean.

It was all amazing, the egg coffee was the best I’ve had by far, if you want to try it or love it already, you have to come here! The Vietnamese coffee was also excellent. The tuna sandwich was delicious and hearty, and came with a complimentary fruit pot. The mango yoghurt was so sweet and flavourful. All in all, amazing food and drinks! Nhien was such a lovely waitress, so kind and welcoming. There’s a nice view of the street, and upstairs is cosy and quiet. A perfect escape from the busy streets, with such a calm, lovely vibe. We could not recommend it enough here.",
      "I have been coming to HCMC for many years and Little HaNoi Egg Coffee restaurants are some of my favorite places to eat. There are a number of them and they all serve great food in a pleasant environment. Previously, my favorite was avocado egg toast, but since they added eggs benedict that has been my go to favorite. They have a whole page of different versions. I, of course, pair it with egg coffee. Potato wedges are optional and make a nice addition."

      "Ask for Jenny! Never been to Korean BBQ. Thought we would give it a go. Wonderful experience. We ordered the meal servicing 4-6 people, it would have easily fed 6. Great selection of vegetables, pork and beef cooked at your table. The meal came with a selection of sauces, quail eggs, broccoli, zucchini and other side dishes. This was followed with a delicious sweet and sour soup with beef and mushrooms. Food was fresh and delicious. Very reasonable priced. Wonderful service and experience.",

      "We found this restaurant on trip advisor and we're able to get a table on fairly short notice. The menu is some 60 pages long. We chose three chef special items to share and it was plenty of food for two. We also ordered two desserts. The presentation is impressive and everything tasted good. Prices are quite reasonable.",
      "My friends from the US were visiting Saigon for the first time - as they are vegetarian with sensitive stomachs and extremely wary of the tap water in Vietnam, I knew I had to bring them to this hidden gem in Thao Dien. In addition to the amazing and relaxing ambience, Laang has a great vegetarian option on its extensive menu. We ordered several dishes off the menu, including the stewed king oyster mushroom, grilled eggplant stuffed with shitake mushrooms, and stir-fried flat noodles with mixed mushrooms. Everything was delicious and my friends were very happy with the food. The pricing is extremely reasonable (6-15 USD / dish) given the ambience and service. If you visit, be sure to ask for Lukas who is the GM and he'll be sure to take care of you. He has deep experience working in F&B and originally worked in a Michelin rated restaurant in Europe. He's extremely knowledgeable about wines so can provide great recommendations if you're a newbie like me. Overall great restaurant with great service and great people. Couldn't recommend more highly.",
      "Nice restaurant with romance view, nice food and perfect service. I got 110% support from staff to setup a dinner for 19 people, 1 of our guest need to use Halal food and restaurant could support me to bringing the Halal food which delivered from another restaurant. I need to deposit 6 M VND for our dinner and could get it back from restaurant within 15hours, very high prestige. 5 stars and high recommended to visit."

They also served great French fries and delicious desserts like creme brûlée, creamy cheesecake with raspberry sauce and brownies. The place itself is very cute and inviting. The hostess and cashier girls were so welcoming and helpful they made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. My family and I ate here twice and If I lived in Ho Chi Minh, I would be a regular here.",

And this is a really good burger, the bread was one of the best I've tasted, although the meat could have been a little more seasoned. Fries were also very good and the homemade chili mayo that you get for free was the icing on the cake.",
      "Marcel the price of the cake combo includes 1 side dish and 1 water and the cheapest is about 220k, the price of the cake is about 180 in the picture, I ate 2 people with soft, delicious meat cake, the crust is very soft. But since it seems that people order a lot with the order of which one is to be grilled, the wait is a bit long. If you go hungry, you will cry :))"

      "The only best halal food in HCMC. The quality of food served is excellent and delicious and prepared with care. The owner is a dedicated man who obviously cares greatly for his business, his food and above all his customers. Halal food a novelty in HCMC and therefore the prices are higher understandably. However, having eaten at other neighboring restaurants, none satisfied me with the quality of their food as Daun did. Other restaurants were noisy, cluttered and served seriously bland food. I think what has happened is that since halal food in HCMC is rare, other outlets don't care about quality as much since the Muslim customers will be forced to go to these restaurants. Daun, on the other hand, is still dedicated to serving great food. For that I am truly grateful. Don't take my word for it. Feel free to compare yourselves.",
      "This halal & veg-friendly outlet is a delightful find💕 The menu is pretty extensive from Japanese to Western and South East Asian. We chose some healthy options - beef broth, French beans+egg, mushroom omelette & tumeric prawn (not on menu but a request that was graciously met). Mr Soffian, the owner, has a genuinely friendly personality with a passion for good service and great food. Wonderful hospitality! We got to try his egg coffee - a yummy concoction that seems like a dessert in a cup! If you’re after good friendly service and yummy food with something on the menu for a diverse group, you can’t go wrong with this eatery. Vert strongly recommended.",
      "Located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, Dau Restaurant offers a delightful blend of traditional Vietnamese cuisine and modern flair. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with a mix of rustic decor and contemporary touches that create a cozy yet stylish dining experience. The menu features a variety of dishes, but the standout for me was the pho, which was rich in flavor with perfectly tender beef. The fresh herbs and spices added a wonderful depth that truly showcased the essence of Vietnamese cooking. I also tried their summer rolls, which were light and refreshing, with a delightful peanut dipping sauce."

I also enjoyed the decor and the music created an intimate atmosphere that allowed our family to enjoy our time together without being intruded upon or intruding on others. My was an excellent waitress, ever solicitous of our enjoyment and comfort.",
      "Monday night is 50% off night and just as well as prices on the menu don’t include VAT or Service charge. Monday night is quite busy. The restaurant has a great ambiance. You get a great pate aperitif with lovely hot bread rolls. The beef is really good quality and tasty. We had one strip loin (a bit of fat rind but really good) and a tenderloin (like fillet, no fat). Cooked medium rare perfect. The wines are very expensive so went for the beer option. The water was the most expensive in Vietnam 140,000 plus tax plus service! It came from France… no idea why! So it came out as the most expensive meal so far in Vietnam - in spite of the 50% discount. But great meal, good quality and service."

The staff was so very friendly and showed us how to assemble our lunch with rice paper, lettuce, mint, basil, kimchi and the pork/shrimp pancake. The sauce (a mixture of the two provided...also demonstrated by one of our lovely servers) to dip in was so delicious I wanted to drink up the remains! I highly recommend this restaurant.",
      "Went by by by chance and were really pleasantly surprised. Fantastic food. Many authentic Vietnamese dishes to choose from. We chose a combo. Pork, rice, boiled cabbage, fish soup and some other things that I do not know the name of. Not spicy, but oh what flavors. A little noisy environment if you want to be a little fussy, but very good speed of serving. Can really be recommended and here we will gladly come again.",
      "Had a great experience at Bep Cuon Saigon! The crunchy banh xeo was absolutely delicious—light, crispy, and packed with flavor. The pork skewers were a highlight, too, perfectly seasoned and grilled just right.

Ordered a couple of beers to be going on with them our starters !! 1 starters each big mistake portion sizes are quite large, wife had the chicken tikka, I had onion pakora both were lovely and the touch of putting you first piece on your plate was quite nice, pakora were spicy and really nice best I’ve had for a while, tikka were lovely big pieces and so succulent. Then we had mains wife had keema mutta (probably spelt wrong) she said it was best she’s ever had just enough spice for her, I had chicken vindaloo, loads of chicken (loads of curry if I’m honest) not quite spicy enough for me usually have them a little hotter but very nice all the same. Portion sizes were quite large neither of us could finish our dishes ! I’d had a garlic naan wife had 2 chapatis not really nice, if we’re ever in HCMC again we shall definitely be back"

      "The Bún Chả tastes good. It is served with soft white vermicelli, mint leaves and other greens, two different fish sauces, and grilled marinated pork patties and bacon strips. What I love most is the Nem Cua Bể, crispy rolls with pork and crab meat. These are served on a griddle and go well with the Bún Chả. The only downside of this place is the tiny size of the restaurant. It can get rather uncomfortable when it is full of patrons. But I would recommend anyone who visits Ho Chi Minh City and would love to taste good Vietnamese food.",

Tracy the staff went above and beyond not just with the service but also when we asked about where to get mangosteen she researched where we could get some as the season for this fruit was over. After the children devoured the pizza we had to order another as it was so delicious! After leaving to go to the recommended spot for mangosteen, we realised we forgot our backpack and the manager/owner went out of his way to drop the bag to us! How kind! The staff are so lovely here and food is of high quality so if you ever fancy a pizza definitely would recommend this establishment! This will be somewhere we will definitely return to eat!",
      "We ordered salad, pasta, and pizza, and everything tasted amazing. Highly recommend the pesto pasta with chicken. Our server Rambo was always attentive and help us through out our ordering with excellent recommendations! He even suggested some nice places to visit during the night.",
      "Accommodating staff and tasty pizza. be mindful it’s a little pricier than the usual Vietnamese dinner prices. We paid 1,400000 VND for 4 pizzas and drinks for 3 adults and 3 kids. Air conditioning is worked well."

      "Wandering around bustling Ho Chi Minh City in search of a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner, we were intrigued by Rice Field , which is located right at the foot of the Bitexo Financial Tower on the opposite side , hard not to find! Original location all in wood with original Vietnamese details , we had dinner on the ground floor , very young waiters in traditional clothes quick and gentle , menu 'extensive at inline prices being recommended on the Michelin Guide . We ordered more dishes, almost all vegetarian, fantastic fried rolls, other fresh rolls of mixed vegetables, sautéed noodles with tofu and vegetables and fried calamari with vegetables, all great, well presented and hearty dishes, sauces and chilli served separately, however they ask for the degree of spiciness you want. Great idea to bring lettuce to wrap the fried rolls and not get your hands dirty! Really one of the best restaurants we stayed in our three weeks in Vietnam. Recommended! Only note, I would recommend more care in cleaning tables and in the bathroom.",
      "Delicious, lots of it. Good service. Central location but reasonable price with mid-range income, 2 people eat about 500k to be full. You should replace the chopsticks with new ones, the current chopsticks are moldy, reducing the customer experience",
      "I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant and I must say it was a truly exceptional dining experience. From the beginning, the welcoming and relaxing atmosphere made me feel at ease straight away. The dish that struck my palate the most was the fried calamari, crunchy and tasty, with a touch of freshness that made every bite a real pleasure. The fried garlic rice was equally delicious, packed with flavor and perfectly prepared. I can't help but mention the Michelin rice cake, which was truly a pleasant surprise: soft and tasty, demonstrating the chef's culinary skill. The service was impeccable, with friendly staff attentive to our needs. The background music helped create a pleasant atmosphere, without ever being intrusive. I highly recommend this restaurant to all lovers of good food and an authentic dining experience. If you're looking for delicious flavors and a welcoming environment, you can't go wrong with this place! I will definitely be back to try other delicacies on the menu. Five stars deserved!"

      "We checked the menu online and picked a location close to our hotel, and cancelled our original choice of a rooftop restaurant or bar, for our last night in Vietnam. The outlet we visited was packed to the gills and we then moved to this one. Despite being very very crowded with a one hour waiting, the staff at the earlier outlet were exceptionally helpful and courteous. Once we got to our new location, from the very beginning the staff was helpful in accommodating our booking change from 2 guests to 4 and gave us a table as soon as they could and tried to ensure we got seats whilst waiting. Every drink / dish we ordered turned out to be exceptional. The servers were very perceptive and understood our requirements and ensured that they clarified about allergens, and to the extent of limitations we may have about other ingredients. It shows the training and culture of the Brand. They also took pains to clarify that some dishes would not suit us or apologise for being sold out! The (very common) Mojito, or the Sangrias or even the Whey cider were exceptional to say the least. The cheese platters with the toasted breads, the pizza, the desserts (esp the terrine) were fantastic Personally, I found it refreshing and surprising that a chain with outlets across countries and cities, was able to rise above mass production and yet retain flavour, presentation as also service. Highly recommend this to all visitors to Vietnam (and elsewhere), and especially to vegetarians / vegans for the choices.",
      "This establishment offers exceptional value for your money, providing not only affordable prices but also delivering high-quality and satisfying meals. The service is not only efficient but also friendly, creating a welcoming atmosphere that enhances the overall dining experience. With such a positive experience, I can confidently say that I will eagerly return to enjoy the delicious food and hospitality once again.",
      "PIZZA 4P’S, a real hidden gem located in district 1 in ‘mini Japan town’. We were completely blown away by the fresh ingredients that you could clearly taste/sense were fresh! Organic, sustainable, local + homemade cheese, reasonable prices for the quality and sweet/proffesional staff, just a very good experience. Don’t be fooled by the name, there’s much more than just pizza on the menu."

      "Great food at a good price was very happy with what we received. Wife had the Crab omelet with garlic fried rice and I had the 2 sausages with onion rings and oyster mushrooms as a side. 10/10 reminded me of good pub food from home.",
      "I really enjoyed this place. I am a lightweight and I am always looking for a beer with less alcohol and have the ability to order in a small glass instead of a pint or something huge and this place hit all of the dots. It also had probably the best tasting, very low alcohol beer I have ever had - chanh muoi ale (salted lime). Thinking about this place too much and will go back when I am in Saigon again! :)",
      "I did not expect to find ‘real’ craft beer in Vietnam. I am so pleasantly surprised. I got a flight; I had the Irish Stout, Jasmine Red, Session IPA, Pomello IPA, Double Jasmine IPA, and the special Stout (I forget the exact name; it’s an extra charge) It was super delicious! Cherry and chocolate notes. Yum! I had the Pasteur Street hamburger which comes with fries. It was delicious. My wife had the Omelette with crab and rice and it was delicious as well. It was also delicious. We had the fried ground duck with rice crackers and the onion rings for an appetizer. I recommend both. The service was impeccabile. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us order food. Everything is in English so there was no problem ordering. My wife does not like spicy foods, so the waiter made sure nothing was spicy, and brought me some Tabasco to spice up my food. I HIGHLY recommend eating here if you’re in the area. There is a bit of variety in the menu, so you’re not limited to one or two choices. Again, if you like craft beer definitely stop by here … and take a flight!"

      "I stumbled upon Hoang’s Kitchen and it turned out to be one of my favorite food spots in the city! I ordered the fresh rolls and the incredibly soft grilled pork with quail eggs — both recommended by Bear, one of the friendliest and most helpful staff I’ve met on my trip. The flavors were bold, fresh, and perfectly balanced. The grilled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and paired with the quail eggs, it hit all the right notes. Bear really went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience — from helping with the order to making great suggestions. It’s the kind of place that feels warm, local, and authentic. Highly recommend if you’re in Saigon and craving something genuinely good and comforting!"

From the moment we entered, the friendly and attentive staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Upon being seated we were served a refreshing starter of cool juice along with wet towelettes to freshen up and clear the dust from our journey through the busy Saigon streets. The menu was extensive and the prices were surprisingly low compared to other restaurants in District 1. Our dishes were served quickly and the food was excellent. My wife and I were discussing whether we could possibly make room for a light dessert when to our delighted surprise our waiter appeared with two small dishes of delicious cubed fruit which was provided free of charge as if they had read our minds. A perfect finish to a wonderful evening out. We will absolutely be returning to enjoy more of the wonderful food, superb, friendly service, and joyful atmosphere provided.

One of the best restaurants we’ve been to in vietnam. They also give you some free crisps/dips at the start of your meal and a free shot at the end of the meal!",
      "The first time I went to La Fiesta I didn't really do the food justice as I was on a diet and so only ate the chicken salad. But the salad was refreshing and the dressing was enjoyable. The chicken was very more-ish too. And the frozen jalapeno Margarita was one of the best, most enjoyable Margaritas tasted anywhere. The next two times I had a delivery of chili con carne which came with french fries, so I made my own basmati rice to go with the chili as rice is my preference and also enjoyed the shoestring fries. I had a side of salad too which was just as fresh and tasty as I remembered. The chili con carne was too much on the mild side for me, although still a delicious flavour, but a couple of sliced red chilis added to the chili soon remedied that and brought it up to the level of spiciness I'm used to. The whole experience was very satisfying and I.m now looking forward to trying many of the other dishes at La Fiesta as well.",

      "This is a lovely relaxed coffee shop that sits above the hustle and bustle of district 1. The cafe is very atmospheric with comfortable indoor seating or section of bar seating on the balcony. Of the coffee options there were clear vegan options (oat milk/coconut). While obviously a little more expensive than more local places, this is still reasonably priced at less than £2 for a coconut coffee with coconut flakes and a complimentary cold tea on arrival. The cafe is above a restaurant, there is a sign for it, and to the left of the sign is a doorway leading to a corridor, at the end of this corridor you go up the steps to level 2. The steps are a decent size and have railing so suitable for anyone who can climb stairs mobility wise.",
      "In April 2024 I visited Vietnam with my son. While we were there, like so many other tourists and locals alike, we both fell in love with Vietnamese coffee and sought out various coffee shops across the country to try their version of the national drink. Tonkin Coffee in HCMC offered some of the absolute best coffee we had during our 3-week stay in Vietnam. We tried out their milk and egg coffees – both were delicious, so much so that we ordered a second coffee while we were there. As we were also hungry when we got to the coffee shop, we had some of their pastries and banh mi. Both were excellent! I should also mention the outstanding friendly service at the café as well. This literal hole in the wall café is located down a long alley hallway and up a flight of stairs, but it is well worth seeking out. I highly recommend this wonderful little coffee shop!",
      "A true hidden gem in Saigon! We nearly walked past it as the entrance is just a doorway, but we’re glad we found it! We both had the Tonkin version of a Vietnamese coffee (mine was iced, my husband went for hot). We also had a custard-filled croissant each which were absolutely lovely! The atmosphere was calm and the staff lovely. Get yourself in!"

      "Tucked away in a smaller alley in Ward 6, District 3 in Ho Chi Minh is this unique restaurant. I had seen online when home in Australia then when in Ho Chi Minh went a few days earlier to make arrangements re: specifics of what I wanted and paid deposit. On arrival all looked as expected. We were given menu immediately and needed to make selections for the night as 4 of the 5 courses had choices ! Easy enough . Had to ask for drinks menu and placed our orders and then courses started to arrive . The cake and happy birthday song came out after the first course. After having our final bite of our 3rd course the assistant waiter had our main course signalling the main waiter to take our current plate away to put main course plate down. We then had to ask as our cocktail was finished could he now get us our bottle of wine we had ordered as would obviously like to enjoy with the main course. Pace seemed very rushed . I had to use google translate to get this message across . This being said food was very nice . Ambience very was lovely . I would definitely recommend for a special occasion. It was also in mine opinion excellent value for money . The waiter was very attentive to all requests when asked and a great picture taker for all different couples , groups celebrating an event that evening Just please don’t rush the food.",
      "Service was perfection as well as the food We were amazed with the foie gras and the angus beef was cooked at the or its best The fish with its crusted top was very good Desserts are ok but not the restaurant best I would not recommend espresso as it was a simple shot of black coffee and not a real espresso"

      "Thank you very much for giving me the chance to talk about my favourite restaurant. The name of my favourite restaurant is Mayonaka and it’s situated in the centre place of the city (175 De Tham street , Pham ngu lao ward, District 1. I like the spacious, serene environment, serves and tasty food. It is a two storeyed restaurant 2nd floor is reserved for different parties or special events. The room is large and The restaurant offers several dishes including exotic desserts, sashimi , sushi, ice-creams the food is more than great) The prices are reasonable and the foods are served quickly and discount for regular customers are two other reasons I like it more than other restaurants in Ho Chi Minh city",
      "If you are looking for sushi at the very highest level in Ho Chi Minh City, you cannot avoid this address. The fish is simply extra class and even Wagyu fillet is served to Fine Dining Fans - and all at a price that is more than just reasonable, because in Europe a dinner in a Japanese restaurant of this class would be good and happy to cost three times as much and then probably not nearly as perfect! Just a big praise to the service and the kitchen! However, since the restaurant is not too big, it is definitely worth the Reservation in advance."

The restaurant served amazing food which was open until 10pm so after our drinks on the sky bar we went to the restaurant to eat. Fabulous 👌 we will return ♥️",
      "Bunbonambo is a good restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but the service is good and the view is good. The lemon lassi is delicious and everything is good, but you have to ask for water separately. I guess they charge extra for water. I asked for a lot of cilantro, and they gave me a generous amount. I was very satisfied with this.",
      "I feel like the restaurant misses the spotlight due to the excellent bar on the roof.... I am a guest at Aira Hotel and usually I avoid hotel restaurants as they are more then usually pretty average. But tonight due to the unfortunate situation of being hit by a motorcycle crossing the road I decided to try the restaurant, rather than go out and risk being run over again... OMG this restaurant is amazing. The staff are so attentive and really care how you are doing, explaining the best way to enjoy each dish, and offer suggestions throughout the evening. But the food is incredible. I went for a set menu, which comes with three courses and a glass of wine. Each course was bursting with flavour and was a joy to eat. The meal was the perfect size leaving me very satisfied at the end. Perfect time to hit the sky Bar and Lounge and enjoy an Espresso Martini!"

      "Super friendly and cozy restaurant with locals and tourists. The staff is very nice. Zin Zin was the one who served me and he taught me how to eat the Vietnamese pancake. Also had shrimp with coconut and rice yogurt for dessert. All very delicious. There’s an 8% tax added to the prices and if you pay with card an extra 3%",
      "Very friendly staff, and could speak decent English. Helped me to pick the right amount of food and showed me photos of what I was ordering. The menu was also in English. Delicious food, and fair prices.",
      "We were impressed by the excellent dining experience at this restaurant. We tried the Vietnamese spring rolls, crispy on the outside, bitten down to make a slight crunch, and the filling was very fresh, full of vegetable aromas and meaty, layered taste. The service was also impeccable, the staff were very warm, friendly, always smiling, attentively answered all our questions and made us feel at home. In addition, the restaurant's environment is comfortable and welcoming, with chic and Vietnamese decor, perfect for parties, family dinners or a drink with friends. Enjoying food in such an environment is such an enjoyable experience that we look forward to coming back again!"

      "We came to the restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and were very happy with how we were treated. The food was a little expensive in my opinion but given how amazing the customer service was, we feel like itâ€™s justified. Definitely will be recommending our friends here",
      "Our favorite rooftop bar for the combination of a group of professional bartenders, range of drinks and great waiters. Outside seating was very comfortable (not the high seating) and service was constant and efficient. I think we came here 3 times. The happy hour is good value. They even gave my partner a wrap when it got cold. That wrap was clean and did the job. The lighted signs make this place attractive. The prices on the regular menu are high but the non happy hour cocktail (Le vie en rose) was very tasty. We had the canapÃ© plate and we thought it was on the small side which is our only complaint. All in all a lovely spot to chill and yes meet some nice people.",
      "This is a beautiful roof top bar with an amazing view and such an excellent service. Liam was kind enough to take some nice pictures of us and helped us select our drinks, the drinks are potent and delicious. The food was good and the vibe is amazing :) youâ€™re greeted with such warmth that you feel like staying here! Highly recommended. Itâ€™s cold so wear accordingly."

A staff member named Pam complimented the menu, everything was delicious and she was really friendly. I especially recommend the eel dish. It's eaten like Vietnamese spring rolls, but it's delicious. The grilled squid is okay, but the sauce is really unique, but it's delicious. It goes well together. Even my dad, who doesn't like the unique leafy flavor, enjoyed it."

The servings were appropriately sized, not huge American portions. The hot pate and compound butter served with the bread basket was a nice touch. We had the sea bass and seafood squid-ink pasta, both were very good. We will probably try it again before going home.

      "I had the pleasure of dining at Quan Que during my recent trip to Vietnam, and it was an experience I won't forget. Located in a charming part of town, this restaurant offers a perfect blend of traditional Vietnamese flavors and a cozy, inviting atmosphere. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure our every need was met without being overbearing. The restaurant itself has a rustic, authentic feel, with wooden tables, lanterns, and beautiful decor that captures the essence of Vietnamese culture. As for the food, it was absolutely outstanding. We started with the Goi Cuon (fresh spring rolls) and Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancakes), both of which were bursting with flavor and made with the freshest ingredients. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Pho – a warm, aromatic bowl of noodles with a rich broth that had been simmering for hours. The balance of herbs, meat, and broth was perfect!",
      "Came here tonight with some friends I’m travelling with and was served by Henry who was so sweet and had amazing service! Spent 210.000VND on a drink and main meal (just over $8), which is amazing value for the deliciously large portion of pineapple fried rice I enjoyed. Thank you Henry for giving us great recommendations- my friends really enjoyed the beef pancake dish which was showed to us how to properly eat it. I was so jealous, it looked so good! Overall great place for all demographics :)"

      "This place has a really nice atmosphere and a light, accessible menu for when you feel like a break the deep-fried delights of Hanoi. We had two salted coffees, an americano, an avocado smoothie, peanut butter sourdough toast and a fruit salad breakfast bowl for 10 GBP. Itâ€™s also right next to the home of the original Hanoi egg coffee.",
      "A cute little spot with an upstairs air conditioned room if you need to escape the Hanoi heat, or a perfect people watching covered alley if you need to shelter from the rain. I visited twice during my visit to Hanoi, warmly welcomed and served by Chi on my second visit. The biggest draw for me was the Italian style coffee offerings (excellent latte) as a break from Vietnamese filter coffee. For those alternative milk hunters, oat milk is on offer. I also enjoyed the oat bowl (which again I think was made with a non-dairy milk). Whilst pricier than local-style coffee/breakfast offerings it was worth it.",
      "Egg coffee is not what you may imagine. It was invented at the 5-star iconic Metropole Hotel in Hanoi when the French wanted a cappuccino and there was no milk. So, frothed egg whites, then frothed eggs, and finally frothed egg yolks were added to make a drink tasting like the best-ever tiramisu. This cafÃ© has been confirmed to be the #1 choice for the best egg coffee ever. I agree!"

      "We were looking for a place to chill out for about six hours until we caught a sleeper bus out of the city and we came across what turned out to be a little gem of a roof top pool bar which Included lockers and shower facilities . The bar is very smartly laid out with a cool design throughout and the seating is very comfortable. The food was absolutely gorgeous and the presentation was fit for the king of England himself ! Specifically, we had the duck, spring rolls, vegetable salad, pumpkin soup and crab fish cakes. The bar itself is great with a wide variety of drinks ! And finally, but certainly not least the bar staff themselves are very warm, welcoming and accommodating which made the whole experience what it was. which when I reflect on my experience at the bar it was simply outstanding and I hope to return or the very least I will recommend my friends and family that come to Hanoi to go and see how great it is for themselves. Big shout out to the bar staff particularly Sang, Vu, Dylan that made it so welcoming.",
      "Staying in the hotel we had an afternoon at the Sky Lounge we enjoyed relaxing by the pool then day into evening had a few drinks and asked the lovely Chien could we eat from the dinner menu? Chien was so attentive and gave us a 5 star service with drinks and dinner. Nothing was too much trouble. A nice casual afternoon evening with amazing Mussels and wine, the largest I’ve ever had! Chien made our experience the best, such a friendly great English speaking member of staff!",
      "Excellent night! We had an incredible time! We will listen to the DJ again and have shots with Fiu, our waiter who treated us very well. If you come to Vietnam, spend a few hours at night having a few drinks and listening to music, highly recommended!!!"

Note that this restaurant is a bit more expensive than most restaurants in Hanoi, we got 6€ per person but it was really worth the cost. I recommend!!",
      "Friendly and fast service. Fantastic Vietnamese food- rice paper spring rolls two different kinds of vegetarian with respective tofu and fried fish in with vegetables and delicious fresh herbs, soy dressing etc- the waiter showed us how, we had to fold them and they tasted heavenly. Clean and neat inside and outside a small terrace with rice paper lamps with light in one could also enjoy the view to the inside- on 1. Sal. Can highly recommend and almost a must",
      "This place has lots of delicious gluten-free options, I was a pleasure to eat their Rice fried and their mango salad. Nice waiters and very knowledgeable about gluten-free, speak very good English, which made it really easy to explain my needs. They made me feel safe! ;) Present so many vegetable dishes, which we really enjoyed. Beautiful discovery, BRAVI!!!! ❤️❤️❤️💛💛🪷🪷🪷🪷"

      "This cafe serves some delicious and affordable options for breakfast and brunch. This morning I tried their dragon fruit smoothie bowl, which was priced just at $3.50. The bowl was full of vibrant colors and flavors - the smooth dragonfruit puree was topped with crunchy granola, fresh fruit like mango and banana. It made for a healthy start to the day. This also has a relaxing, cozy ambiance and the service was friendly. Besides the smoothie bowl, they offer a range of coffee drinks, pastries, and other breakfast about $3 to $6. Overall, it's a nice spot to grab a quick but quality meal without breaking the bank. I'd recommend giving the smoothie bowl a try if you're in the area.",

      "Incredible experience. Staff is knowledgeable about food, wine and general hospitality and provides personalised service. 10/10 would recommend the indulgence menu, great quality for a reasonable price, and premium, tasty dishes.",
      "We attended this outstanding establishment in September 2024. My partner and I had planned to elope in Sapa with our parents, however Typhoon Yagi had other plans for us and we instead got married in a forest outside of Hanoi. Scrambling for a place to celebrate our nuptials we emailed several restaurants including the French Grill. From our initial correspondence with the helpful Assistant Manager Ms Nga Nguyen onwards, our experience was nothing less than magical. Ms Nga Nguyen was completely sympathetic of our change in wedding plans and the entire team at the French Grill went out of their way to make our evening as seamless and special possible, including arranging a beautiful flower arrangement for our table even though the restaurant does not typically use flowers as part of their décor. We secured the Burgundy Room, a semi-private dining area that suited our needs perfectly. One of our party is vegetarian and had a delectable six course dining experience which was delivered and explained with as much care and thoughtfulness as the Indulgence Menu, chosen by the rest of us. We were served by the knowledgeable and charming Kian who was respectful of our need for privacy but equally seemed to be able to anticipate our every need and answer our every query with professionalism, grace and consideration, and even managed to delight and surprise us multiple times during the evening with his thoughtfulness. Kian, we wish you all the best with your career as a sommelier and have no doubt that you will be successful in all that you aspire to do. On to the food. Frankly, I was concerned that our parents would feel out of place and ill at ease with \"fancy French food\" that was completely unfamiliar to them. I need not have worried. My 79 year father has told us (and everyone he knows) repeatedly that the meal he had at the French Grill was the best he has had in his life and easily the highlight of his 2024 (even more so than presiding over our marriage ceremony in a the forest which was pretty spectacular). The Snow Crab was a real favourite on the table and each plate appeared more stunning and show-stopping than the dish before. There is a chocolatier on site and although we were all stuffed to the gills by the end of the night, the team brought us a selection of goodies as a parting gift and we all seemed to be able to make room for the deliciousness that followed - we cannot recommend trying the chocolate strongly enough. A huge thanks to the entire kitchen staff at the French Grill for a meal of a lifetime, unfortunately we did not have the foresight to ask for any names for our review (which we did not really intend to write as we never do, but thought the French Grill deserves all the public gratitude it can get). Overall, our night at the French Grill was so incredibly memorable and perfect. Budding photographer Nga Nguyen took some lovely photographs of our group and called us a taxi as we sadly said goodbye; she made us feel truly cared from from start to finish. We must thank mother nature for changing our destiny as we would not have had the pleasure at dining at this truly special establishment if our wedding had gone ahead as we had planned.",
      "We enjoyed a family celebration at the French grill and absolutely loved it. The hostess, manager, waitresses and bartender were all amazing, bringing a small cake while singing happy birthday and making fun special mocktails for the table. The filets were ridiculous and the kids loved the lobster bisque and fresh bread with various butters! Thanks for a memorable night during our stay at the JW Marriott!"

This was also the only restaurant in our entire Vietnam trip to charge an additional 8% VAT so we ended up paying 455,000 VND in total. Note also this restaurant only takes cash. I also felt that we were short served as we ordered two serves of cha ca which came out in a single pan but we would be lucky to have 5 small pieces of fish each (can barely see the fish under the veges). However, the meal itself was very tasty. So overall I feel that this place takes advantage of tourists especially if you can't speak Vietnamese.",

      "If you're in Hanoi and looking to indulge in one of the city's most iconic dishes, Chả Cá Thăng Long is a must-visit! This cozy, family-owned restaurant specializes in Chả Cá, a traditional Vietnamese dish featuring grilled fish served with fresh herbs, peanuts, and rice noodles. From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted by the sizzling aroma of fish being grilled right in front of you. The fish is tender, slightly crispy on the outside, and beautifully flavored with turmeric and dill, creating the perfect balance of taste. It’s served with a variety of fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and peanuts to add crunch and freshness to each bite. The portion size is generous, making it a great value for the price. The staff is friendly and quick, adding to the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the restaurant. If you’re in the mood for an authentic taste of Hanoi, Chả Cá Thăng Long won’t disappoint. It’s a quintessential Vietnamese experience that lives up to its reputation and then some!",
      "Nice restaurant in the historic center of Hanoi, with tables outside and inside. As soon as we arrived it was very crowded but (even though we had a reservation) we were able to sit immediately on the first floor. The staff did not speak English very well, they presented us with the (basic) menu, asking us if we agreed to order 2 sets of menus. Without really understanding what they included, we took the plunge and asked for spring rolls too. The setting was immediately prepared for us, with different sauces, herbs and noodles to accompany the main course, which was served in a convivial pan placed in the center of the table, on a small stove used to complete the dish at the table. We were also shown how to compose the dish (lightly breaded fish fillets, with dill and other vegetables) using the ingredients previously brought to the table. All very pleasant and light, the spring rolls served separately were simply fabulous!! Extremely appropriate and low bill compared to European standards (€18 for two with drinks, water and Pepsi). Ideal for a taste of Vietnamese cuisine in an authentic, no-frills venue. For a quick meal! Advised!"

      "We heard that Don Duck 2 in the old quarter was highly recommended and had their version of a Michelin star so we went there with high expectations, and we were not disappointed. Whilst the restaurant is small and on multiple levels it is best to book your table before arriving as even in the early evening the restaurant was packed. As the name suggests it specialises in duck based dishes but does still cater for those who wish to dine on something else. As a lover of duck dishes I tried their Duck spring rolls and was blown away at how good they were followed by Grilled duck on the table whilst N chose a chicken dish with rice which she thoroughly enjoyed. Finally whilst the food and service was exceptional the cost was significantly lower than one would expect from a Michelin star restaurant with main, (duck), courses starting from as little as 155,000dong.",
      "Going off google reviews we found Don Duck… wasn’t disappointed.. good to see a restaurant specialising in one product and doing it 100%. Small aircon eating area downstairs, more seating upstairs. Staff were exceptional. Drinks cold and well priced - due to being busy they have us complimentary spring rolls while we waited. It was only a 10 min wait.",
      "Our family had the pleasure of dining at Don Duck Old Quarter Restaurant in Vietnam, and it was an experience to remember! We ordered a variety of dishes including the Crispy Duck Spring, 1 1/4 Roasted Duck, Stir Fried Chicken, Vietnamese Beef Steak, and Seafood Fried Rice. Each dish was fantastic, bursting with authentic flavors and cooked to perfection.The Roasted Duck, in particular, was a standout—tender, juicy, and wonderfully seasoned. The Crispy Duck Spring was a delightful start to our meal, and the Vietnamese Beef Steak was a delicious twist on a classic. The Stir Fried Chicken and Seafood Fried Rice were also excellent, perfectly complementing the rich flavors of the duck dishes.Our meal was accompanied by refreshing drinks: Watermelon Juice, Lemon Juice, Coke, Orange Juice, and Lavie Water, which paired well with the food and added to the overall enjoyment of our lunch.The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, making it a great spot for a family meal. The staff were attentive and provided excellent service throughout our visit.We highly recommend Don Duck Old Quarter Restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy authentic and delicious Vietnamese cuisine. It’s a must-visit if you’re in the area!"

      "L’essence de cuisine is a good spot to go for dinner, but I’m not sure it deserves to be ranked as one of the best in Hanoi. I don't specifically have anything bad to say - the food just didn’t blow me away. The service was very good, the ambience was nice and the presentation of each dish was carefully thought out. However, I don’t believe it should be ranked in the top 5 of the city. I did not feel that the food on the couples tasting menu was that memorable or flavourful enough to justify the price. It was definitely tasty, but not super unique. They are always looking to improve so I’m sure that this restaurant can work it’s way up to be a top location in Hanoi.",
      "Had a wonderful dinner at L’essence de la Via Cuisine. The food was absolutely delicious — every dish full of flavour and beautifully presented. The cocktails were expertly made and really added to the experience. What stood out most was the exceptional service — the waiting staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel so welcome throughout the evening. Highly recommend this place for a special night out. Top marks all around!",
      "On our last evening in Vietnam we went to eat at this place, hoping to end on a high note. Instead, despite the pleasant environment, we ate poorly, in fact we almost didn't eat, because after the first tastes we didn't like the food. Unfortunately, our evening was ruined, because we had no alternatives for that evening, we didn't trust ourselves to go, at a late hour, to another random restaurant in the center of Hanoi, and so we were left disappointed and fasting. My husband gave it a negative review. This fact and this unpleasant situation cannot be erased. However, after a few days, when we had already returned home to Italy, the owner, not present on the evening of dinner, refunded us the bill paid, after having been asked, through the email with which we had booked, for the data banking. Making mistakes in the kitchen, or in the dining room, can sometimes happen, and it has already happened even in the best restaurants. Fully refund the amount paid, days later and 13,000 km later. It had never happened to me before. Compliments. It seems right to me to also review this correct behavior."

      "We had a wonderful experience at The Rhythms (33–34 Hàng Dầu, Hanoi) celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary. The restaurant thoughtfully decorated our table and provided very attentive service, making our special day even more memorable. Prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was cozy with a perfect amount of space between tables, ensuring privacy and comfort. Special thanks to Hằng (Katie), who was extremely dedicated and caring throughout the evening. She made sure everything was perfect for us. The food was delicious, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. We highly recommend The Rhythms to couples and families looking for a lovely place to dine and celebrate special moments!",
      "It's like going for dinner on the last day of our trip to Hanoi. I ordered a Vietnamese course and steak here. The course meal was more delicious than expected and the portion was sufficient. The steak I ordered was served after the course meal and before dessert. Perhaps because I was full after the course meal, the steak was not as tasty as I expected. There was little Maillard on the surface of the meat. I especially ordered T-bone, but the tenderloin was so small that I thought it was l-bone. The steak was cooked the way I wanted it to be, but it was a little disappointing, but I enjoyed it. Dessert wasn't that great. I think it would be better not to eat it. The server in charge of us treated us kindly, which left us with a good memory. I would like to visit again next time if I have the chance."

      "We stopped into The Hudson Rooms at the top of the Capella Hotel for drinks and a snack before dinner at Backstage. The top floor space is gorgeous as is the rest of the hotel. It is reminiscent of top floor lounges in Hong Kong. Service is sophisticated and high end. Our shrimp cocktail was five tiny shrimp for a healthy amount of money, but I expect to pay for such a swanky bar. Drinks were fine and equally as expensive. The Hudson Rooms is a special place in Hanoi. It is worth the cost for that extraordinary setting."

Drank a cold beer for 30,000. The staff is super friendly and will be happy to change the menu if you have an allergy to something or you just don't want it. For example Cilantro. The restaurant is larger than it can be seen from the road, there are several tables in the room at the back. Definitely worth a visit.",

      "We visited Luk Lak Restaurant in Hanoi after seeing it recommended in the Michelin Guide with a Bib Gourmand distinction. The location is convenient, right near the Opera House, and the restaurant itself is spread across three nicely decorated floors, creating a pleasant and welcoming ambiance. The menu offered an impressive range of dishes, with photos and detailed English descriptions to make ordering easy. The staff were lovely—very friendly and attentive, adding to the positive atmosphere. For our meal, we chose the following: • Cua Lột Sốt Me Cuốn Bánh Tráng: Deep-fried soft-shell crab wrapped in rice paper with fresh herbs and seasonal vegetables, served with tamarind sauce. • Gà Nướng Tú Lệ: Grilled chicken with lime leaves, accompanied by sticky rice from Tu Le and special house-made sauces. • Vịt Cháy Tỏi: Pan-seared boneless duck with garlic from Ly Son, Thai basil, and pickled bamboo shoots. The portions were generous, and the presentation was good. However, the flavours didn’t quite meet our expectations. The lime leaves in the grilled chicken were almost imperceptible, and while the duck dish was better, it wasn’t particularly memorable. Overall, we were a bit underwhelmed given the restaurant’s reputation. It’s worth a visit for the ambiance and service, but the food might not leave a lasting impression. (Also posted to my food blog on Instagram @AbbeyKing16)",
      "Luk Lak is a clear step above the average local restaurant without being significantly more expense. We enjoyed it so much the first time we dined there that we came back a couple of nights later. The room is well presented with a reasonable amount of space between the tables and we found the food delicious.",
      "The restaurant spans three colonial-style floors, each exuding a nostalgic Indochine charm. The first floor houses a cozy café, while the upper levels provide spacious dining areas adorned with custom paintings celebrating Vietnamese heritage. Guided by Chef Madame Binh, who brings over 25 years of experience from Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi, the menu is a testament to Vietnam's rich culinary diversity. Dishes are crafted using regionally sourced ingredients, ensuring both authenticity and freshness. As Asians we enjoyed the restaurant so much that we returned the next day. Highly recommend the Stuffed Pigeon with Sticky Rice, where tender pigeon meat is combined with sticky rice, wrapped in lotus leaves, and grilled with five-spice seasoning, resulting in a flavorful and aromatic dish. The Nem Lụi Huế was also good. The Nem Ốc Hà Nội must have been unqiue but we took the soft-shelled crab spring rolls instead. I believe they have the dồi huyế, blood sausage but we were already too stuffed. The Restaurant offers an impressive wine list that rivals those of many top-tier establishments, yet at more accessible prices. Their selection encompasses a variety of sparkling, white, rosé, and red wines. I found some not so big names ones like Damilano Barbera d'Asti DOCG which i definitely recommend with the meats."

      "A must visit place for the view after sunset. The place is on the 67th floor with an open roof. You can go to the 67th floor after touring the sky observatory deck. However once you’ve gone to the top of Hanoi you aren’t allowed to come back down to the sky observatory. Really loved the Vietnamese techno being played there. The live music band is also good and playing a lot of jazz versions.",
      "Very special place with a beautiful view of the city of Hanoi. You can have dinner at the Poano restaurant downstairs and then you can go to the terrace to have a drink and see Hanoi from above. Expensive restaurant but the food is good. Drinks on the terrace at prices from 6 to 10 euros. Recommended"

      "What a fantastic experience at Hanoi Fusion. The food was absolutely beautiful and the service from Zo was exceptional. The restaurant itself is so inviting and perfectly laid out even with dining on a mezzanine floor. The prices were very good with a family of 4 having a huge feast and two rounds of drinks at a very low price. I cannot forget to mention the Hanoi special smoothie oh so good! We will definitely come back when we return to Hanoi in a few days. We are so pleased our Tour Guide Quan mentioned this restaurant to us.",
      "We had a lovely meal at Hanoi Fusion! We tried the seafood pasta and the tenderloin steak—both were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. The seafood was fresh and the steak was cooked to perfection. While the space itself is a bit small, the restaurant is spread across three floors. If you're willing to climb a few stairs, the top floor is definitely worth it. It offers a charming open-air dining experience with a great view of the street below, adding to the overall vibe. Highly recommend for a cozy yet flavorful dining experience in Hanoi! Would you like it written in a more casual or humorous tone?",
      "We came here through a friend's recommendation, the food and drinks here are very delicious and the prices are reasonable. The cozy space is very suitable for those who like quiet, the staff is friendly, enthusiastic and cheerful. We will definitely come back."

      "My husband and I passed by this unassuming restaurant in a small back street and decided to stop in for dinner. I can not emphasize enough how incredible our meal was. We ordered duck leg noodle soup and fried rice with duck leg and an egg. The noodles were firm and chewy as home made noodles should be. The broth was complex with a depth of flavour that can only be achieved from hours of simmering. And the duck was tender and delicious. The sauce on the duck leg combined with the fried rice and the jammy egg made each bite perfection. We will definitely be back again. This is one restaurant not to be missed.",
      "Best food I’ve had in Hà Nội! Tucked down a cosy alley near the cathedral, this place is a real find. The food looked gorgeous and was delicious, with all the condiments you’d expect on the table if, like me, you want to ramp up the chilli as you eat… Friendly staff, easy ordering, great prices, and the music was brilliant, too. Perfect lunch!",
      "Great food with affordable price. We tried the noodles and dimsum as well, both are fresh, rightly flavored. The service was 10/10 i believe, the servers were gentle, responsive. The location is easy to reach, right in the heart of the Old Quaters, definitely recommend this place for both local people and tourists"

They have Omakase, Teppanyaki, A la carte as well. Our bill was $100 for 2 people (we order a la carte) including drink and we were super happy with such a beautiful experience. Service here they follow Forbes Standards and this is the only standalone restaurant in Vietnam is doing so (What the manager shared with us). I have a look at Lunch menu and prices are even more attractive, $11 for a lunch set as I remember, definitely need to come and try next time.",

      "It was a great experience! The price was 50 USD for two people, including one bamboo snake and drinks (including alcohol). The owner, Dragon, was friendly and very charming. We were able to talk a lot about the restaurant and the food. Because it was a weekday, we were able to talk a lot with Dragon, so I recommend visiting on a weekday when it is not crowded with other customers!! First, you are asked to choose between a bamboo snake or a cobra (which is a little more expensive). Next, if you want, you can see the moment the snake is killed. You can also choose whether to drink the heart and blood. After that, you order a drink, and the dishes made with the snake you just killed are brought out one after another. … The taste is excellent. Depending on the cooking method, it tasted like chicken, fish, or eel white meat, so it was fun. By the way, Dragon likes dirty jokes. The serve is humorous and the atmosphere is somewhat mysterious. There is no other restaurant as wonderful as this! Eccentric!",
      "An incredible experience. It is a little far from the center but it is worth experiencing. Mr. Dragon's treatment is unbeatable. He is always joking so that you have a good time but at the same time you can talk seriously with him. They have a Bamboo Snake or a King Cobra (the first one is cheaper than the second one). We opted for the first option and for the price we agreed upon, they served us the snake in 7 different ways (all of them delicious) and all the drinks we wanted. 100% recommended if you are in Hanoi, we loved it.",
      "family reastaurant. kind workers. the owner (dragon) was very kind to show me the snakes served in the restaurant. if you come alone give a call to the owner to check if there is a dead snake already, otherwise, you need to pay for a whole one. great place to come with friends and great snake dishes!"

      "Very nice ambience, cozy lighting. Charcoal barbecue at the table is awesome. We had the Wagyu set (USA) for two people (3*130 gr) and additionally ordered an Angus Ribeye (130 gr). Meat quality excellent, we found the best Wagyu pieces with higher fat content. Due to the ripening, the meat has a special taste - extremely delicious. Just add some salt and pepper and you're done. As a side dish we had a green salad, grilled vegetables and potato wedges and as starter fried dumplings. The quality of the side dishes was also top. We paid 90 € (including beer, water, cocktail), which is of course expensive for Vietnam but quite inexpensive for this enjoyment. Also the service was top. Our waiter Trinh has a very pleasant attentive nature and helped us with the barbecue (the meat is pre-grilled medium-rare and then finished grilling at the table grill according to taste). Conclusion: If you like to eat meat and want to treat yourself, this is the place for you.",
      "Excellent place to eat grilled beef and pork. A great combination of cuts that serve with very delicious Korean tapas. The salads are very delicious too. The price is a little higher than the average of other restaurants; but it is well worth it for the quality of the meat, the combinations of sauces and different types of salts.",
      "Dining at this Hanoi steakhouse is a world-class experience, unique in its charm. The quality of meat is exceptional, rivaling the best steakhouses globally. Their cocktails are a delightful journey in flavors, adding to the exquisite dining atmosphere. The staff strikes a perfect balance between attentiveness and discretion; they're not only highly professional and fluent in English but also intuitively responsive, ensuring comfort without intruding on your privacy. It's a place where culinary excellence meets impeccable service."

      "I had the pleasure of dining at RK Spice Indian Restaurant during my visit to Hanoi, and it was an experience worth every bite! Nestled in the vibrant Old Quarter, this restaurant serves some of the most authentic Indian food I’ve had outside of India. The menu is extensive, offering a range of North Indian, South Indian, and Mughlai dishes. The flavors are rich and bold, with each dish prepared to perfection. I particularly enjoyed the golab jamun—an absolute treat! The butter chicken was creamy and delicious, and the naan was freshly baked, soft, and warm. One of the things that stood out to me was the simplicity of the restaurant. RK Spice isn’t about fancy interiors; it’s about delivering incredible food at reasonable prices. This approach has clearly resonated with diners, as the place was buzzing with both locals and tourists alike. The service was top-notch. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, making sure our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish. Whether you’re a fan of Indian food or someone looking to try something new, RK Spice should be at the top of your list when in Hanoi. If you’re in the Old Quarter and craving a taste of India, don’t miss out on this gem! This should provide a different perspective while highlighting the key features of your restaurant.",
      "We came across this place when looking for an alternative to all the Vietnamese restaurants. The food was excellent, especially the many mutton dishes and the service was prompt and friendly. The owner, a cricket aficionado, was very attentive and keen to know what we thought of the food. We would certainly recommend this as a spicy and tasty alternative while in Hanoi.",
      "I visited this restaurant last week and had an excellent experience. The food was delicious, full of authentic flavors, and made with fresh ingredients. The staff was friendly and welcoming, providing great service. Prices were very reasonable, making it a great value for money. If you're looking for tasty halal food in Hanoi, this place is a must-visit!"

      "I was walking to eat at around 9pm on a weeknight, and I passed once, but went back and entered. The reason I decided to enter the restaurant was that it was clean from the outside. I travel alone a lot, so I have a lot to worry about when I eat, but the friendly staff here said, \"There's a table in the back of the shop, which one would you rather have?\" It was very impressive that he confirmed his intention. Even though I was a single guest, I was very grateful to be shown to a quiet back seat. He understands that I'm hot and adjusts the fan, and is very considerate. Order Xôi Hàng Quà for dinner. I ordered it without any prior knowledge, so I was curious about what kind of meal would be served, but it was a bowl of so-called sticky rice topped with meat, sausages and vegetables. Many restaurants around town have stiffer meats, but that hasn't changed here. The flavor is just right. The amount is also satisfactory to most people if it is an adult male. It may be a bit more for women. After the meal, order an additional Vietnamese coffee with salted cream. It tastes good in other cafes, but I was able to enjoy it well here. There's plenty of ice in there and there's no sense of cutting corners at all, which you see sometimes in Vietnam.",
      "Hi, I'm Teresa from Singapore. Their salted coffee and sticky rice were delicious! The staff was approachable & friendly and I had a very nice chat with him (I forgot to ask for his name). They have a very adorable Corgi mixed Siberian Husky dog (Dom). Thank you for the very pleasant dining experience for my last night in Hanoi. Highly recommend this place! :)",
      "Food and coffee was just amazing. The cafe is really cozy and friendly staff ;). The Bahn mi sandwich was simple but memorable. The rice combo dishes and chicken noodle soup are perfect light lunches."

      "We had an amazing meal with entrees and main, the meals were very large serving and so tasty, the staff were amazing the drinks were cold the aircon was on and it was just a great experience. Highly recomend the pork belly bites, the ribs the steak and the garlic bread all the foods we had. Yum",
      "We’re in Saigon on a school trip from the UK, two teachers with ten teenagers. The students asked for a mix of western and Vietnamese foods for dinner and we stumbled across The Big Pig which beat our expectations. Being such a big group we managed to reserve a table a couple of hours earlier. We had a warm welcome on arrival and we’re quickly offered food and drink menus. There was a great choice of food to keep everyone happy. The students told us the Smoothies were the best yet (and they’ve had several from across the city!). The food was tasty with generous portions all came out fresh and hot from the kitchen. We had burgers, pizzas with a lot of side dishes and left with many clean plates - a huge sign of happy teenagers! Fab place for tasty food to please all tastes, and really well located right by the Siagon Skydeck, making our evening even easier. The staff were excellent always on hand to help and serve us quickly. Brilliant work.",
      "Really professional friendly service, welcoming and polite showing my wife and I the full food menu and drinks menu before we were seated by Lewis who was brilliant 🤩 Our waiter this evening was Le Nhu Y who was exceptional in his service. A friendly smile and a very warming personality who makes guests feel so welcoming. The restaurant is very spacious with a few levels. The beer was ice cold and the cheeseburger & fries was really nice reminding me of a good burger from back home,many thanks for your service 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

      "We were served by Chris, super helpful and cute, we took as an appetizer the rolls with crab and that with mixed super good fish and combined each with a sauce in my opinion much better those with crab. Then bamboo cane skewers with chicken and sweet bread balls also paired with a semi-sweet sauce with salt and lime to accompany. To conclude shrimp skewers with super spicy mixed spices accompanied with clouds and squid in super good tamarind sauce in total we spent in 3 the modest amount of 59 €. The place super clean and very cozy.",

      "The service was super friendly and efficient! When all the food came out it was all hot which is amazing for 6 burgers. Quan was super funny and friendly. Speaks English quite well so it made for good conversations and great service. Even gave us some recommendations to see in Hà Nội. Even though we came quite late and close to closing time they didn’t rush us or degraded the food quality or service so we all really enjoyed it. The burgers were juicy and delicious and the the truffle chips are a MUST. Would recommend if you wanna change up from Vietnamese cuisine to some American styled burgers.",
      "If you are traveling in the city and feel like burgers, you can eat here with pleasant and not too loud music. Personnel: I was served mainly by the very nice Mike, but can also say that the others were also very friendly and always had a smile on their lips. To the kitchen: I had a burger (fresh ingredients that you can also taste) with fries and dessert. In terms of taste and appearance, a recommendation from me. For the price: Although a bit more expensive (about 13€ incl. dessert and drink)."

      "I stayed at this restaurant with friends because we felt like a nice hamburger after days of local cuisine. The place is faithfully reminiscent of the American ones, the staff is welcoming and friendly. We tasted the classic burgers (very good) with chips and coke (you can refill the drink for free once you finish). We spent about 10/15 € each, including two desserts that surprised us particularly, given the loyalty with those eaten in America.",
      "We looked up restaurants close by and Eddie's came on the scope. So we popped in for dinner and tried some burgers, what sensational burgers absolutely top class and the staff were attentive to our needs and happy to engage in friendly chat. We will definitely be back for more. Also the apple pie was the best. Our main man Tai who served us was the best.",
      "Eddie’s is the real deal! Started by an American ex-patriot from Minnesota, it serves up fresh, authentic diner food in a casual atmosphere. Where else can you get a tuna melt in Saigon? Eddie’s serves breakfast all day, along with burgers, cheese steaks, fries, onion rings and even chicken parm! Yes, they make their own ice cream, too. Servers are fluent in English, so there’s no menu-pointing required to order your favorites. When you’re half a world away from Katz’s and craving a corned beef Reuben, Eddie’s is the place."

Found this atmospheric Italian restaurant about 100yards from the New World Hotel and were seated on the first floor balcony. Food was delicious with a couple of us having Lasagna and others fish served by delightful staff.",
      "After two weeks on the road in Vietnam, we wanted something a bit different for dinner. We found this place online and decided to try it out. It was a great decision ! . Walking distance from our hotel, we went upstairs and sat outside to watch the happenings on the street. It's not too noisy and the weather was warm. The very nice waitress was with us in minutes and we ordered a glass of red and white house wine, a salad, and some pasta with prawns and a pizza. The salad was fantastic, the wine very good and the pasta and pizza as good as you'd get in Italy !! . The dinner was that good that we actually went BACK the following night for dinner and it was brilliant yet again ! Same waitress, very nice - and friendly service. . Around $80 Australian dollars for 2 and that included bottle of wine. . Highly recommend.",
      "The restaurant was close to our hotel and after a long trip walking around the area looking for dinner. We both ordered pasta dishes finished off with the passion fruit panna cotta. The pasta was ok, the dessert very good. What warranted the rating was the attentiveness of the staff which makes all the difference."

It is on Tran Vu, the first street after the bridge to the left. Not a big place, probably very busy at night with the bar. We ate upstairs, very quaint. Food is excellent. The French onion soup & creme brûlée were outstanding. I had a special which was similar to a shepherd's pie but made with duck & it was delicious. My husband tried the lasagna - it was good but not what he would consider lasagna. We ate here a second time and had the hamburgers, really done well. It's not easy to find Western food in Hanoi.",

      "A very good indication is always if an Italian restaurant outside of Italy, has many Italian or native speaking Italian guests. Long story short: service, food, drinks – summarized – very good. You can spend a nice evening there in a relaxing atmosphere with good music in the background. Price - value is in a very good ratio",
      "A trip to Italy even in these times is possible, no visa nor CoVid test required. This restaurant serves the very best of Italy: atmosphere, great flavours and dolce vita. The refreshing Aperol Spritz creates the first WoW, awesome al dente pasta, homemade minestrone, antipasti della casa follow before the main course. We love the pizze e calzone, also the grilled fresh tuna steak with olives, capers, oregano and tomato sauce. Prosecco sweetens our lunch before delicious Tiramisu and Panna Cotta with berries. Not to forget the sound of the typical Italian coffee machine producing worldclass espresso. Adriano Celentano & Monica Bellucci join us for the grappa and Amalfi coast limoncello... Viva l’ Italia",
      "Maybe the best Italian in town with homemade fresh pasta like linguine alla Sarda with fresh prawns, mussels in a slightly spicy tomato or white wine sauce. We love the original Napoli style pizze and the house special ravioli and truffle risotto. Feels like a trip to Italy 🇮🇹 despite travel restrictions! Cheers, btw their Aperol Spritz is fabulous, followed by delicious Panna Cotta or Tiramisu and iced Amalfi style Limoncello... buon appetito"

      "We found this place by accident, as it’s not centrally located and has such an unimaginative name. It was such a pleasant surprise, as this is undoubtedly among the best phở in Vietnam! Go for the house special; the delicious pho broth and cooked meat (which includes brisket and oxtail) is served in stone bowls, so remains piping hot for almost the whole meal. You can order extra sides, like tendon, blood, an egg, etc, but sadly no tripes. The raw meat and noodles come separately, and you throw them into the bowl. Unique among phở restaurants anywhere in the world, they make their noodles fresh from scratch here, and you can observe the whole process through the glass window. Boy, it makes a difference, freshly-made noodles are much, much better than the packaged dry ones served elsewhere. Crispy yu-tiao (extra price) is left on the table; I highly recommend you dip it in the broth for additional delish texture. Service is excellent, they’re super quick at bringing you requests for extra stuff, like fresh lime, etc. Our go-to",
      "Crowded restaurant, mainly frequented by Vietnamese. Just pho with fresh pasta and beef (your choice of fillet meatballs, tail ribs, etc.). Served either in bowls (small, medium, large) or cast iron casseroles filled with boiling broth into which you throw the raw meat, your fresh pasta, your Thai basil and your bean sprouts. From 70,000 to 110,000 VND. It's exotic, it's noisy, it's fast. Everything we love about Vietnam."

      "Firstly I’d like to say thank you to Xavier and his staff for a lovely experience in Ho Chi Minh City for their friendly approach making you feel very welcome in Cocotte, a truly beautiful restaurant. We were both blown away with the quality of food and drinks at a very reasonable price. Signature dish is the French Onion soup covered in Emmental cheese which tasted like a traditional dish. We also had the Tuna with Wasabi beurreblanc and the beef ravioli, both were excellent and washed down with a very nice bottle of Cremant which was excellent. Many thanks for a great evening.",
      "I discovered Cocotte through a friend's recommendation. Located in Sila Urban Hotel, I tried the food here last week and found myself smitten with the pan-fried duck breast served with a fragrant black pepper sauce. The dish stands out more when paired with a glass of red wine, stimulating the dish's richer taste. In addition, the space is also very chill, and the service is extremely friendly. I will definitely come back.",
      "This is a French restaurant that really impressed us. The food was delicious and the price is really reasonable. Another nice surprise was that we found the exact taste we had in France (some of my us are french). A place you should try! And enjoy some of the best dishes that are also signature dishes of this restaurant: duck magret, duck confit, rosbif"

      "Wonderful food! Would definitely recommend if you are vegetarian too - my friend is and she really enjoyed her meal. Our waiter Kien was very helpful and he showed my friend how to eat her “traditional Hanoi pork” with rice paper. He also had a lot of patience with us when we were sorting the bill.",
      "The food at this restaurant was some of the best my wife and I have eaten in Vietnam. Went back twice in 4 days and both times the food was excellent, portions generous and service quick and friendly all at a very reasonable price. The make your own Vietnamese pancake was especially delicious. The restaurant was clean and welcoming but not fancy decor wise but that doesn’t matter as the food is the main event. We booked a table through their Instagram. They do walk ins but each time we went there was a queue for that which seemed to have around a 15 minute wait time. Would highly recommend for great food and service",
      "My husband was looking for somewhere for our last dinner in HCMC and found De Tham. We were warmly greeted and fortunately for us, a comfortable table had just opened up so we were quickly seated. The menu is good with plenty of regional options plus a fairly extensive vegetarian/vegan selection. Our waiter, Jack, was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly so any questions we had were answered and we felt very well taken care of. My husband ordered us the fried eggplant as a starter and had the grilled beef served in bamboo as his entree while I enjoyed the caramelized pork and quail eggs. I had a glass of red wine from Dalat Vietnam and a lime soda (lime juice, a can of soda water and a small jug of simple syrup so you can mix it to your palate!) and my husband tried a couple of the Vietnamese beers they offered. The eggplant was crispy and tasty and we enjoyed the chili sauce for dipping so much that Jack brought us more. The beef was delicious, tasted chargrilled and looked appealing served up in bamboo. My bowl of pork and quail eggs was so comforting, the broth tasted like it had been simmered with love for hours at Grandmas house. We shouldn’t have ordered the banana split to share but we did and had no regrets, it too, was well executed. Prices are reasonable for District 1 and portions quite generous. Thank you Jack for taking such good care of us!"

      "Culinary experience of the highest level, where flavors of Asian cuisine steeped in spices and aromas give life to an alchemy that demonstrates the personality of the chef, less experienced in molecular techniques, expressed in many courses between spherification and gelation not perfectly successful. The rest very well worked out. Michelin is rigid in its 360-degree evaluations... here it has blindfolded in the service, albeit sympathetic waiters. Minimal tone in the mise en place. Too bad they replaced the wine glass with a beautiful water glass in fine Hungarian crystal .. Modest location , jap style but advanced technologies that maybe make you feel in an interstellar space and that, fortunately, you forget as soon as you are out to find yourself in the magical Saigon.... long live Vietnamese Cuisine!!",

Rita was our server, and she was so helpful that it made the entire experience seamless. Highly recommended!"

      "The setting is superb. Fast and efficient service despite the size of our group. The dishes are very generous (too much) but not as fragrant as in the other restaurants where we stopped during our tour. The spring rolls for example were huge but only tasted like meat. Spring rolls not as good as elsewhere. Completely incomprehensible: we asked for towels to replace the wet towel intended to cool our hands. There are no paper towels and wet ones are charged extra...",
      "This restaurant downtown was suggested by our guide. The façade of the restaurant is very lit and richly decorated with plastic plants and flowers. The interior consists of various rooms and other tables are in a large courtyard in front, all lavishly decorated. The tables are pretty close. The menu was very varied and enriched with photos to illustrate the individual dishes. Food is normal and portions plentiful. The service was efficient considering the considerable number of tables but completely impersonal. There are no architectural barriers to get to the front tables.",
      "In the central area of Ho Chi Minh City, this restaurant offers a well-kept environment both inside and outside. The service does not shine for friendliness but you eat well and with a wide choice. I definitely recommend it also in light of the now 2 weeks of local cuisine. I count around 30 euros for 4 dishes and 4 beers."

The staff were extremely knowledgeable of the business ethos and how they value not just quality coffee but genuine relationships with their coffee suppliers and methods of growing coffee that are sustainable.",
      "Staff is friendly and study coffee well. They can recommend suitable coffee based on your demand. They serve tasty cascara tea for free after you enjoy the coffee. Only a pity is that some pastry are already sold out even I came early in the morning. Not easy to find this kind of cafe for special coffee beans. Price is quite expensive compared to the typical Vietnamese coffee shops, however it worth trying !"

It is a very spacious, modern area with tables, more relaxed seating and chairs at the bar as well. The mostly young staff are well trained and have great communication skills. Our waitress on both occasions, Huyen, was extremely attentive and eager to please. She recognised us the second day and greeted us warmly which was lovely. We were very impressed!"

      "This is a super cute little Belgian beer bar, cafe and restaurant just a couple of minutes walk from The Pink Church and directly opposite Quan Pho Huong Binh for those of you on the Michelin credited pho restaurant trail, as we were. We noticed it across the street and stumbled in out of curiosity. Lovely, rustic wooden decor over several floors in a typically narrow HCMC-style dwelling squeezed, almost impossibly, into the shaft of space between buildings. A huge selection of bottled Belgian beer and several good quality staples on draft as well (I had a draft Vedette, she had a bottle of Grimbergen blonde). Really lovely staff - the young lady who served us was particularly helpful in recommending the best pho places to visit if you want to eat like a local. Hint: they are not on the Michelin credited list. But if you want to find out more about that, I suggest you pop in and ask yourself…",
      "The first time I came here, I was impressed by the cozy feeling and the unique decoration style with beer bottles, creating a very suitable space to enjoy beer. The shop has many varieties from Belgium and has many choices from light to heavy, serving many customer groups. The service staff are very enthusiastic and attentive. I will definitely come back again!! ✨✨",
      "I had the opportunity to visit Lagom and was really impressed with the way the shop represents the culture of Belgian beer. First, the restaurant's space is very comfortable and cozy. I feel like I'm in a little corner of Belgium. There are many unique decorative details, including paintings of famous Belgian beers. Soothing European-sounding background music creates a relaxing atmosphere ideal for enjoying beer. The shop's biggest strength is its diverse Belgian beer list. I tried many different beers and each one was interesting in story and rich in flavor. The bar's staff is very knowledgeable about Belgian beer and helped me choose the one that suits my taste. In addition, the shop also has a variety of snacks to pair with beer. I tried a few dishes such as a delicious cold charcuterie cup and a plate of beef with fragrant red pepper sauce. Although the prices are somewhat higher than some other shops, for all that the shop offers, it is a worthy experience investment. If you are a Belgian beer lover and want to experience the country's authentic beer culture, this is a great destination. I will definitely return to this restaurant in the future."

      "Residing at Le Meridien Saigon where this restaurant is located, I tried it for both breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is of a good standard, not a lot of choice and variety but what is there remains of quality. The fruit and/or vegetable juice freshly centrifuged to order is very appreciable. For dinner, however, I ordered a la carte, again not a lot of choice but well-prepared dishes in a mix of international and local cuisine. The price is very high for Vietnam but considering that this restaurant could be in any other metropolis in the world, you choose when you want to be safe",
      "Tonight I dined at Le Meridien restaurant on Ton Duc Thang Street, District 1. Although the restaurant is buffet, I tried à la carte to experience the food here. I must say that the dishes I ordered to try were Mekong salad, cod fish eaten with rice... especially the fries served with shaking beef were delicious, very delicious. And the attentive, cheerful, enthusiastic waiters made the atmosphere as well as the meal more delicious. Thank you Yen, Van, Ngoc, My Dung, and Thu, for your very dedicated service.",
      "Came here for breakfast and was impressed by the service. The waitstaff are responsive and kind, and speak English well for those who do not speak Vietnamese. Maru Nguyen served us and was polite and friendly. She speaks English well and was able to answer our questions with ease. The food was good, with choices of American breakfast, Chinese food, pastries, and Vietnamese food. Nguyet or Luna, the head chef who makes Pho, is very personable and greets you when you come to her station. She is very helpful and makes great food recommendations. The pho that she and her staff makes is delicious! My family and I had a great experience."

      "The restaurant's understated and elegant décor is a perfect interpretation of French sophistication. The specialty steak is served with a secret butter sauce, and the meat is tender and juicy. The wine list is impressive, with a selection of wines from Burgundy to Bordeaux. The service team is professional and welcoming, giving us a true sense of French hospitality. The most amazing thing is that they follow the traditional French recipe strictly and each dish is full of craftsmanship. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth a special occasion. This is a rare romantic dating spot in Saigon!",
      "The signature entrecôte steak was cooked to perfection, swimming in their secret sauce. Generous portions had us swooning, while the authentic French atmosphere transported us straight to Montmartre. Absolutely smitten with their crème brûlée!"

      "Honestly, one of the best restaurants I’ve been too. The location and the view is beautiful, and they have live music with a good variety on music type on saturdays that made the vibe even better. Now, the first impression, except from the view was the staff. All the staff were smiling and seemed happy which for me is very important that you can see and sense that they do wanna be there and work, and that you’re not bothering them or that they just wanted the evening to be over. Our waitress of the evening was Mocha and the service she gave was first class in my opinion as a former waitress. She went out of the way to explain the dishes to us, recommending dishes and ordered small portions for us to try. One thing I was impressed by was that she noticed that I ate the oysters raw, and therefore she recommended other dishes that contained raw fish like ceviche. She made sure that we had everything needed and didn’t mind to do everything so the evening would turn out the best for us as customers. The food was so fresh and seasoned so well. The range of seafood wasn’t very big but here it’s definitely quality over quantity and honestly, you don’t need much more than what they have. The only thing I can point out was the pasta dish that they prepare upon order. If you start with it, it might turn out great. But we had it for last and after all the fresh seafood it tasted a bit too salty for us. But definitely nothing wrong with the seasoning or so. In conclusion, I would not even hesitate to eat here again.",
      "Great service and great quality of food! Our server Mocha was the best, she was very attentive and gave us great hospitality, truly a 5 star rating. The A4 Wagyu and fresh seafood was Devine and worth the price, definitely would recommend!",
      "My wife and I went on her birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed the late lunch, we had the 990,000 dong Pho (which was a whole different experience - the meat quality of the Pho is better here but the flavor of the Reverie pho is better in my opinion. Com ga Hoi A was a pleasant partner to the Signature Pho. The service from Mocha was exceptional. We also appreciated the birthday cake (gratis) and Mocha taking endless pictures of us and the surrounding breathtaking views. Landmark is also known for its great seafood buffet."

Couple of dissatisfaction points: mains a little lacking for vegetarians - we asked for vegetarian fajitas instead of chicken but restaurant was not willing to improvise to accommodate; If you are wine drinkers make sure you check they have enough bottles in stock for your group (12 people), ours ran out after 2 bottles - restaurant had no equivalent price alternative, the next option was almost twice the price. Could improve with accommodating customers better.",
      "We had anniversary dinner here and were absolutely blown away with the food we received. It was beautiful and some of the best food we have ever eaten. Wasn't cheap by Vietnamese standards but to have the same quality meal at home we would've paid double the price we paid here. Would recommend this restaurant for any couple that want to treat themselves whilst on holiday 10/10",
      "This is a great, vibrant restaurant with excellent food, cocktails/drinks and service! The atmosphere was lively as it was busy with lots of young people enjoying HCMC at night. There was a couple of birthday celebrations that staff supported with a cake and singing. My partner chose the chilli con carne and duck and I chose the warm cheese & chorizo and seafood with orzo. All of the food was delicious, hot and plentiful. We were given a cheesecake dessert free as there was a very slight delay in the main courses not arriving together. Staff were helpful, efficient, smiley and created a lovely atmosphere for a great dining experience! I would highly recommend this restaurant 😊"

Great place to relax and watch tourists come by. A guard is at the only entrance. A cafe owner will come and bring you in. It’s their way to manage the crowd given the authorities’ concerns with safety issues given the trains. You can choose which cafe to go to.",
      "Check train times before you go so you can see the train. The train goes past about 9 times a day, some are spaced a hour or so apart and some in the evening. There are about 10 spots to stop and have a drink on the small section of track. Of course you have to purchase a drink to sit down at a shop but it’s the standard price. 20k - 50k for a beer with lots of juices and snacks to be had. We stayed for 45min and had 2 beers a ice tea and a smoothie for 115k dong. If you don’t want to spend money you can walk up and down the track and just take pictures for no charge"

Eg pancakes for duck are incredibly thick and doughy, the dishes are highly salty (maybe don’t check your blood pressure reading on the same evening of dining). Pricey for Vi standards but a nice treat if you fancy something different. The dim sum (crab and prawn) cannot be faulted and the service is speedy. Solid 3.5/5.",
      "We ate there early, so we had the benefit of a quiet restaurant. I can honestly say I don't remember the last time I ate dimsum so good! Fresh ingredients.... every prawn dimsum was meaty and you could see and taste the prawns... it was really outstanding. Also the Hong Kong style pork was great.... Our server Ván Anh was extremely friendly and helpful! Huge compliments to her. Overall really no complaints, and I would definitely eat here again.",
      "Very average food with a Pekin Duck ( the house specialty, it seems..), served with only one kind of sauce (no Chinese mustard, no pickled chilli) chewy and tasteless. The Dim Sum were standard, with little difference in taste from one to another. Dining rooms are pleasantly lit, the service efficient. Last visit."

      "It looked like a classic Vietnamese souvenir shop, and I walked to the hotel in front of Hanoi station where I stayed. It took me about 10 minutes to get there, but I found myself facing a road just down the street, so I had to rely on navigation if I didn't know. There was a showcase of cakes as soon as I entered the store, and when I ordered recommended products and drinks, they served me to the eat-in space at the back. Further into the eat-in space was a handmade workshop where visitors could watch demonstrations. There was a dedicated corner by the entrance for tea and souvenirs, which could be purchased here, but because it was hot outside, you had to be careful about the take-home time.",
      "I came to the cafe for the sweets. It's fun just looking at the sweets in the cafe's showcase. The beer mug-style chocolate sweets I was looking for were not sold out yet. There are so many types of chocolate in the shop corner that it can be confusing, but you can sample them. You can have fun selecting items. I chose a standard set as a souvenir for home. The price is high, but you can buy it cheaper than buying it in Tokyo."

      ". Ate here on our first & last nights in Vietnam, initially recommended by our hotel reception . The ambience was tranquil, with an airy semi open area at front and plenty more space under cover Tables were spaced well apart and the food delicious, My duck breast was perfectly cooked & my husband’s stir fried beef fillet soft and succulent. Desserts were also fabulous. The staff were lovely, just the right level of attentiveness. A special mention for Chilie, our lovely waitress on both occasions- she recognised us straight away on our 2nd visit even gave us a sketch of our meal, drawn while we were eating, to give us as a memento. This is the perfect spot for a celebration or just a good slap up meal.",
      "Gorgeous restaurant with event outdoor and indoor seating. Set menu was the perfect amount of traditional yet elevated Vietnamese food. The spices, flavourings, and textures were really a cut above other places we have eaten (and loved) in Vietnam. On top of this the young, vibrant staff (who all speak fluent English) were impeccable. Both polite and friendly it made us feel really at home. Special shout out to Ms Chi Le who also gave us a great bar recommendation for later!",
      "We dined in this beautiful place. The restaurant , in a beautiful house elegantly restored , is quiet and offers a lovely room and two charming courtyards. We tasted refined dishes full of flavor and finesse. The kitchen is really upscale! The welcome of the whole team is exceptional , Miss Chile is adorable, professional and speaks very good English. Thank you , it was a last dinner that ended our trip to Vietnam and we will keep a wonderful memory. Do not hesitate to discover this place in Hanoi!"

    "description": "Founded in December 2008, La Badiane -French for Star Anise spice- is heralding its claim to be one of the best restaurants in Vietnam, dedicated to fusion of flavors and international gastronomy. As reference, La Badiane is rated top 500 Restaurants in Asia by The Miele Guide, has been recommended by The New York Times, and has received 5 consecutive Certificates of Excellence by Trip Advisor -since 2011. Indeed, with more than 300 upvotes as “EXCELLENT”, La Badiane knows a high rating deserved to top-end restaurants. Yet, if most is about tastes, fusion of flavors and international gastronomy, great attention is also constantly paid to the quality of the service provided as well as to the overall atmosphere, so guests have a unique culinary experience by enjoying every aspect of their meal. When coming in, one’s attention is instantly caught by the multitude of perfumes & aromas flowing out from the open front kitchen. The entrance corridor planted with harmonious luxuriant vegetation leads you towards the heart of the restaurant, and its glass covered patio. Surrounded by carefully chosen leaf plants, walls predominantly white, and large B&W photo portraits, the place provides for a true feeling of calm and elegance. The combination of tablecloths, two-color curtains, and the green vegetation gathers all conditions to let guests’ visual and gustative senses fully express themselves. The attentive and discreet lightening in the evening makes it very romantic, and live classic music concerts every Wednesday evening levels-up La Badiane restaurant to turn it into a complete place. On the upper floor, two rooms available provide for perfect intimate spaces, appropriate for guests either looking for privacy, or mid-size groups wishing to enjoy a private lunch or dinner on a special occasion. As opposed to the ground floor and its B&W photos, the first floor presents large-size color portraits. A must-see.",

      "Tonight, my wife and I ate at La Badiene, and the experience was simply wonderful. I booked the restaurant from Australia via email - the communication was very easy, clear, and timely. From the moment we arrived, the staff were fantastic - chilled, but super attentive. We had the degustation menu and at their suggestion we had the Signature menu and Fusion menu and shared each dish, this doubled the number of dishes we had, but also doubled the amount of work for the kitchen and staff. Throughout the meal, the waiters offered additional bread, making sure that we had enough for the pate, etc. The meals were beautifully crafted, full of flavour, and complemented the other courses. On completion of our meal, our waiter helped us book a Grab (Uber), and another of the staff waited with us until it arrived. We often eat at restaurants, but La Badiene is exceptional - Great food and wonderful staff. If you're in Hanoi and looking for a special night out, this is it. 11 out of 10",
      "This is a beautiful place. We ordered a four-course lunch, and the quality started incredibly high and gradually declined over the courses. I think the starters were best because they were relatively simple, so the excellent preparation and great flavours really shone through. But the mains and desserts felt over-complicated, with too many ingredients, not all of which seemed to belong together. They'd look great on Instagram, but weren't so satisfying to eat. Overall, though, a very good meal. The staff tried hard to provide what they clearly think of as good service, but to me it was very annoying. They were constantly fussing over us and making a big production of doing simple and/or completely unnecessary things like unfolding napkins, clearing crumbs from the table and putting down empty plates between each course and then taking them away again. But when we actually wanted something, they were nowhere to be found, and the bill took so long to arrive that my wife had to get up and fetch it herself. To me, good service is unobtrusively efficient, but this was inefficiently obtrusive. Probably wouldn't come back.",
      "As you walk through the entrance with the glass panelled kitchen, you immediately feel special in this place of warm welcome sophistication.. from the beautiful black and white portrait prints that adorn the walls, to the head chef Benjamin coming and introducing himself to customers. But wow.. it’s the the tastes & the fusion of flavours, combined with the quality of service that you must come and experience. There is so much creativity in the combination of flavours & spices that pair so well together. Do yourself a favour when looking for a special meal. Come to this place. They have well priced degustation lunches that change weekly or simply try their individual meals… whichever you choose you won’t be disappointed."

      "One of the most expensive Western restaurants I've ever been to and enjoyed. The Nordic food menu is extremely diverse, including ordering by portion or individual dishes. We got to try a lot of strange dishes that we have never tried before. When the wait staff brought it out, they fully introduced the name of the dish and even the main ingredients of the dish. Each dish is served in a fairly small quantity, we came here to determine this in advance and the price is also very luxurious. Professional and polite service staff, luxurious space.",
      "I have been to this restaurant since attracted by reviews. I must say that what I tasted was partly amazing, partly normal. There are some things that, perhaps out of Italian habit and not only, did not convince me so much, like the fact that wine and water are not left at the table, but the waiter, every time he sees the empty glass comes with the bottle and pours what you need. Too bad that the white wine we chose arrived at the right temperature only at the end from dinner! That said: - pros: environment and dishes, some dishes with exclusive taste, attentive service, but not too much; - cons: drinks not left available to diners, some dishes with a bit 'flat flavor, price in my opinion not justified compared to the offer and prices of the place (although I understand it is a high-end restaurant), the waiter who once outside the room (right on the street), asks which dishes were liked more and which ones you liked less ... even today I do not understand why these questions are asked outside the restaurant. Otherwise, would I come back? Safe not. Would I recommend it? Yes, if you have an additional budget to spend differently... as I said above, some dishes are really crazy!",
      "Giving T.U.N.G. Dining anything less than five stars is a travesty and does a disservice to creative cooking. Listen, I’m 74, was part owner of three restaurants, and have dined at the culinary temples of the world including many three star Michelin restaurants. T.U.N.G Dining is on par with most of them. Our 17 dishes tickled our senses of smell, taste, and sight. The culinary journey was a trip to Wonderland and Oz. The photos tell part of the story, but everything also tasted delicious. Service was charming and helpful, and everyone displayed pride in what they were serving. Pricing is extremely high for Vietnam, coming to around $280 for two including tax and tip. T.U.N.G. Dining is worth every penny."

      "Wonderful classy French restaurant. My wife and I went on a recommendation from a tour guide and were not disappointed. Beautiful setting and excellent food and service. We had the four course option with wine and everything was great. I’m not a real big dessert person, but with the 4 courses I selected the strawberry/orange cheesecake and it was flavorful, smooth and light as air. Amazing. And for those who come from another big city (we come from NYC) the cost is very reasonable. Highly recommended.",
      "We had a price fix dinner that include a voice of appetizers and a selection of entrees. Included were dessert and wine. Food was excellent. I had the Basa Fish Bouilabaisse style entree which was quite different that other Bouilabaisse dishes I have had in the past. This did not have a broth, yet it was terrific.",
      "We were very impressed with the quality of the food, the ambience in the restaurant, and the attention the staff paid to us. We could not fault anything. A well-informed local recommended to us the restaurant for fine French dining. We ordered two sets comprising Starter, Soup, Maim and Dessert. The choices for the sets, which we consulted with the staff, as well as for wine, turned out to be perfect. The beef cheeks, particularly, were juicy and delicious. A meal like this for one person would easily set us back by more than A$100 in Australia, but we paid under US$60 for two. Thank you for giving my wife and I such a beautiful dining experience. You are an important addition to Hanoi's fine culinary scene."

      "We just enjoyed a tasteful lunch at this small but famous restaurant. Food was very fresh and service was good although the restaurant was crowded and it all went very quick. Would certainly recommend to visit this restaurant if you stay in Hanoi. It definitely is worth visiting",
      "I was told to by the glove driver, but I had made a mistake. But I had never eaten Buncha before, so I tried it. I eat a sweet dipping sauce with vegetables and noodles. By the time I finished eating, I was bored with the sweetness and greasyness. Fried spring rolls are delicious."

      "Very conveniently close to the Masjid an Noor. V good quality Indian/Pakistani cuisine , very reasonably priced. Friendly and efficient service. No long wait for good food. Be cautious when ordering especially on a hungry tummy...The portions are very generous and the meals on the menu are often substantial enough for 2 adults to share. If you've over ordered management will gladly oblige if you have leftover food to be packed for taking home.",
      "One of the best Indian Restaurant in Hanoi city and is very close to maximum hotels. Food is so Delicious and Tasty in reasonable best price. The team is very polite and humble. I recommend people to prefer this Restaurant without any doubt.",
      "Vietnamese people may not like Indian food, and the price is higher than the average of local restaurants, but I love it! Authentic spice cuisine, you can eat delicious vegetarian or meat, masala, thali, biryani... It is worth exploring here. In Hanoi, a city full of imagination, eating delicious South Asian food is totally worth the money!"

      "First of all, the restaurant is more than rustic, the chairs and tables are hand-made, the floor is bare concrete; the air is quite smoky due to the various table grills. The restaurant is always busy, however, as it is comparatively cheap. The barbecue itself is an experience, you grill yourself at your table on small charcoal grills, we tried beef and pork, both very nicely marinated and nicely flavorful! In conclusion, it's not for a quiet dinner for two, but if you like grilled food and a good beer, you're in good hands here.",
      "Great place for cook your own bbq - great atmosphere and service. Ordered the eggplant which was amazing along with the morning glory with garlic. For the bbq the pork and beef were both delicious but the octopus was very tough. The accompanying sauces were all delicious too. Beers were ice cold."

      "We were looking for a romantic setting with Vietnamese cuisine, knowing how much my girlfriend loves Vietnamese dishes. As Vietnamese ourselves, we’ve tasted countless dishes across the country, but KotoSt25 redefined our palate of how Vietnamese cuisine can be presented in such an elegant and exuberant setting. We opted for a set menu at Koto, which was authentically Vietnamese, rich in flavors that brought us back home, yet delivered with a Western twist that elevated our dining experience. Every bite was a rediscovery, from the spring rolls with well-braised Vietnamese-style Wagyu beef to the perfectly steamed ST25 rice. My girlfriend indulged in three cocktails, each beautifully mixed and served, with the standout being the “Canh Chua”— which amazes us enough as its taste uniquely captured quiet much resemblance to the Vietnamese tomato soup but still fit itself nicely to indulge as a cocktail. Staffs were incredibly attentive, friendly, and took lots of their effort to explain the ingredients and stories behind each dish (though we barely remembered all the details 😂). Their warmth made us feel truly appreciated and cherished. We were even greeted by the hotel’s GM and the restaurant manager, who made their rounds to ensure every guest was enjoying their meal—a truly memorable touch. It was a night that brought us even closer as a couple, and we would highly recommend KotoSt25 to anyone looking to share a lovely evening with their loved one.",
      "Lovely dinner with braised Australian wagyu beef cheek spring rolls and the Halong Bay oysters for entrees. Springs rolls were hot, flavourful, and a nice start, as were the oysters, which were huge. Our mains were the slow roasted half bbq chicken and the crispy pork belly porchetta with seasonal asian greens and the fried rice with mushrooms and baby corn. The bbq chicken was well worth the wait and was tender, moist, and full of flavour while the porchetta was very tasty but huge and more than enough for two people. Finally, our desserts were rice pudding and the pandan waffle with strawberries, cream, and soursop ice cream. The coconut and mango rice pudding was the best we ever tasted with a beautiful texture and was simply genius. The waffle for me was the perfect finish to a lovely meal. Our server, Thuy / Mille was friendly, patient and very attentive with a very strong interpersonal skills. Very approachsble and professional at the same time. 10/10",
      "Large open kitchen restaurant with lovely attentive staff, explained the dishes when presented etc etc topped up water when the glasses got low. Food was fantastic, we had the half chicken (knowing it would take 45min) and some Asian greens and of course a bowl of ST25 rice. Spring rolls for entree were great, full of beef and a great way to start. Was offered to have greens and rice whilst we wait for the main but chosen to have it together. Fantastic flavours and topped it off with dessert. We would def come back here again. Looking forward to it already. At the time of our visit they were open for lunch but only on weekends. Last dinner orders taken I think was 1030pm so a great option for late dinner. Accor Plus discount applied, I think the max discount was 30% food and the usual 20% for drinks)"

      "Went here on the complete off chance. My wife found it looking on the internet as she fancied some tapas and it did not disappoint. Food and service was excellent. The waitress was very helpful and would not let us over order and the food arrived in the perfect amount of time. Not too quick but slow enough to know it was all being prepared freshly. Open kitchen so you can see the action. Very clean and a very nice ambiance. Would highly recommend the sucking pig.",
      "Excellent food , tasty small plates to share. You won’t get tired of the same flavors ( like in a large portion) try lots of different and interesting dishes. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and good suggestions if you’re not sure what to try. Open kitchen was fun to watch the dishes being prepared! We went there twice and was not disappointed!",
      "Our group of 6 selected the We Pick, You Eat 6 course tapas menu for 900k/per person and it did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the service excellent. Our only complaint and it's a small one, was that the wait time between dishes was quite long."

      "We were taken to this place by a local employee... the place looked nice but the food was way too expensive. She ordered japanes wagyu beef, black pork mini burgers... I was surprised because it was delicious, the meat was fresh, soft and sweet... We've been to other Korean places downtown and we found them to be even better here than the original. Wow Korean restaurants in Vietnam are better than Korea, very surprising!",
      "Really good option if you're looking for something a little bit different to the local food but don't want to go for the stock options of Pizza, Burger, Pasta. We ordered a Combo meal - so a selection of different meats BBQ'd on the hot coals in front of us and it came with a wide selection of Korean style sides. Very filling and overall and excellent option. Unlike Korean BBQ I have been to in the UK/Ireland, the food is cooked for you and in front of you.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"

      "Looking at older reviews I had become a little worried, but after being served two beautiful medium rare pieces of meat by a lovely waitress, I'm happy to say this is a lovely little spot found in the art arcade in saigon. With wonderful service from the staff and pleasant Aussie cuts of beef which are about A3 rating. As someone who normally enjoys a good rib eye fillet or sirloin cut at home along with tomahawk, I know when I'm eating a well cut and cooked piece of meat. I highly reccomend the second serving platter consisting of a 350g rib eye and 350g sirloin which is cheaper than buying them separately. These also come with 2 complimentary side dishes, I don't reccomend the potato wedges and it would be a sin to eat such good quality meat with the mac and cheese, highly reccomend the sauted mushrooms. Don't be afraid to try a red with these lovely cuts as it develops overtime. To us, this was a wonderful experience with calming atmosphere.",
      "Really great food. -I went back a second time. (And I heard the table near mine raving about how good their meals were as well) Excellent service. When you rock up with an allergy list nearly as long as your arm and they accommodate that. You know the waiting staff are attentive, when you order a drink and they bring it to you, without ice, because that is how you ordered it the other time. You know they paid attention when it comes to ordering the side and they say 'you didn't eat the mushrooms last time would you like to try the salad or something else this time?' Cute location too.",
      "Absolutely delicious meal, my husband had the wagyu steak which was cooked to perfection and I had the beef steak with rose cream pasta which came with a whole steak! Absolutely delicious, wonderful ambience and lovely host. I would highly reccomend coming here over the commercial restaurants on the square. Thank you very much!"

      "Genuinely excellent food, a class above most fine dining restaurants and it was absolutely delicious throughout. I’d strongly encourage a trip even at the high costs, but… Two things stick out to me: 1. I’m still hungry. Every dish of the tasting menu was very small, and despite being very tasty I’d have gladly had a decent amount more food even if it meant sacrificing a dish or two to balance the costs. 2. A little bit of a bitter taste left in my mouth by the staff at the end. We’d made a point to ask for the bill early and to pay quickly because we had somewhere to be, yet they genuinely seemed to be making no effort to facilitate this (and indeed collecting payment from other tables ahead of us even though they were clearly not finished with their food/drinks and in one case had just had fresh drinks delivered). Overall though despite these (meaningfully frustrating) complaints I can’t bring myself to go less than five stars because the food really was exceptional.",
      "This was an excellent Michelin star experience. Know that it’s not like say an Alinia in Chicago, it’s a casual but food centric pleasure in a Vietnamese food market sort of way. Think like say Direkte Boqueria in Barcelona,(but at a typically lower Viet price point). The premises are very tall and very narrow but they manage to space everyone out in an appropriate way. They even quickly upgraded us to the air conditioned first floor from the breezy rooftop We opted for an à la cart experience although there were several rave reviews about the more expensive mixed fixed menus. The Foi Gras egg roll, while small, was loaded with taste. The duck mango salad was perfectly seasoned and very ample. My wife and I then shared the main course, choosing the pork chop specialty. Very tasty and tender. A nice surprise dessert cake for our anniversary, along with the fish sauce caramel vanilla ice cream topped off our meal and sent us off very happy and very satiated As I said, simply adjust your lense from an elegant high end Michelin to a casual but very flavourful Michelin experience. It’s all part of the fun. By the way, the staffing was very ample, all knowledgeable, warm and efficient.",
      "Service and food are very good at this Sài Gòn Michelin star eatery. The layout is on five floors, all small spaces. We ate in the roof- dry pleasant. Creative cocktails, tho’ my berry mocktail was too sweet for my taste. The fried rolls of shrimp & crab were terrific, and the deep fried fish was delicious, with the meat served in chunks on the crisp body of the whole fish. Plating of all the dishes was creative. We felt the vanilla ice cream dessert with fish sauce was a bit much-excessive showmanship that bordered on tacky. That sauce was served in a little cologne spray bottle. Fish sauce by Dior😂? The food here is expensive, which it always has been. 6 of us ate for more than $200, and we did not order wine, just drinks. I’ll still return here for a special occasion & memorable meal."

      "I went to this vegetarian restaurant with friends, relaxing and welcoming atmosphere, attentive to detail. We tasted dishes at the beginning of the dinner, which we shared (fried tuber, potato type ..) and each we chose a dish (fried rice with mushrooms, rice with pineapple and raisins ..). All very good, accompanied by fruit drinks (orange, lime and pineapple). Recommended dinner to enjoy a different evening, from the usual bars that are in the city. Cost for the city above average, we spent about 25 € each. Recommended!!",
      "The photos people have shared are excellent, but there’s so much more to experiencing all that is this building and what goes on within. The food is on another level when it comes to creativity and deliciousness. The design of the interior design compliments the beauty of the plates being served. The staff are outstanding. The photos are outstanding, but the smells and flavors are something you must experience yourself.",
      "After a stressful day, Hum truly felt like an oasis of peace. The atmosphere was calming, and the food was amongst the best we've ever tasted, with plenty of delicious vegan options to choose from. The staff were wonderful, going out of their way to help us select the perfect dishes. Special thanks to Phoung Vu for his exceptional hospitality—he looked after us so well, making sure we were 100% happy and satisfied throughout our meal. It was a dining experience we won't forget, and we highly recommend Hum to anyone seeking incredible food and warm service."

      "Central location, atmosphere of a rich man’s home in the countryside, and most comprehensive menu of typical dishes from all regions of Vietnam. Only missing are fertilised egg embryos (trứng vịt lộn or balut in the Philippines). None of the dishes is the best in its category, but they’re all pretty good. Excellent service from friendly staff. Prices are very reasonable; ignore comments from cheapskates who would be better home eating at the market or just staying home!",
      "We ate here twice during our stay. First time we ordered nine dishes as we didn’t have a clue about Vietnamese food. Next time we went we had a better idea on what and how much to order. The prawns were excellent and the waitress put on gloves and peeled them for us. Very informal dining but a lovely way to spend an evening. I would class it as outside dining and maybe the floor could be cleaner but that’s down to untidy diners. First evening was £40 nine dishes, bottle of wine and two beers. Second time £32 less dishes same amount of drink.",
      "No air conditioning, but plenty of fans to keep cool. Right across the street from the Independence Palace. Good place for lunch, but also okay for dinner. This place is rather informal in a good way. Menu has lots of pictures and English translations of each dish. Perfect restaurant to experience local cuisine in a setting that isn’t too fancy (not like those white tablecloth french colonial restaurants). The menu is quite extensive—like the Cheesecake Factory in the USA, so you can try a variety of Vietnamese exotic dishes if you’re feeling adventurous. Bathrooms reasonably clean."

      "The quality of the food was very good and the service attentive and prompt. We enjoyed the setting and the fact that there was no loud or inappropriate music. Less agreeable was the fact that all courses of a three course lunch were served on a tray simultaneously. This inevitably meant that the main course was cold by the time we had consumed the entrées. Perhaps the management interpreted a Business Lunch as placing the emphasis on speed and efficiency. In our judgement this should be reviewed in favour of a \"course by course\" serving approach rather than \"all at once\". (The day we ate there were only a handful of other diners so there was no time pressure on the staff.) This would considerably have enhanced our enjoyment.",
      "First class service in a building of a long and vital heritage. The menu was well combined und delicious prepared while everything was of a high quality standard fitting to the higher prices here. Especially if you search for a location which is quiet and has a great view this restaurant is a good pick.",
      "I feel quite satisfied I suggest that the lamb dish in the set needs more fat in the sauce. Because sheep don't eat dry food. Dessert and appetizers are okay for me The waiters here are very cute, Tran is very enthusiastic and gives thoughtful advice"

      "Second visit to this restaurant and really worth the trip: DELICIOUS, fine, tasty. Bcp people but it was Friday night, better book. After a small papaya salad with beef jerky grilled absolutely divine and to finish in style of banana grilled with coconut juice and here even the decoration and service were at the rendezvous.",
      "Excellent service and amazing food. We ordered several dishes to taste and all of them 10/10. We were told we were ordering too much food for 2 people so they advised us which dishes to remove, which proves they care about customer satisfaction over financial gain. Loyal to the service and the food. The building itself is unique and deserves a mention. Highly recommend if you find yourself in Saigon!",
      "This restaurant is fabulous from the stunning external design, the interior decoration, the interesting menu and the helpful and attentive staff. We had been recommended to this restaurant by some travellers we met in Hoi An. When we got to HCMC we tried to book online but there was no availability. We took a gamble and turned up shortly after opening time and helpfully they managed to fit us in. Ms Nhu Lam patiently helped us through the interesting local menu and we had a chicken with sticky rice under a dome, a beef dish, some greens and from memory we had a rice dish with duck. They really get the attention to detail right without being over fussy. Mr Phuong Vu and his team do a great job!"

It is on the 28th floor so the view is great and the restaurant is decorated nicely. I do think they could choose different type of music with more ambiance, but it is not loud, so this didn’t bother me too much.",

We came for the omakase experience and it was around $100 per person which was reasonably priced and the food was delicious. I thought it was little at first but by the time we finish the whole tasting, I was so full. Hung, our server, was very attentive and took good care of us. My husband loved it and we would come back next time we are in the city.",
      "A very upmarket dining experience in a private Japanese dining room just for the two of us (yes, shoes had to come off before entering, tatami mats everywhere). We could order from two menus one Japanese “Towa”, the other Cantonese “Lai”. We started off with an incredible sashimi spread prepared by Towa’s chef before moving onto a selection of Cantonese dishes from Lai and finished up with a huge bowl of fruit. There is also a great selection of teas available by the pot in the Towa drinks menu if like me, that is your preference over alcohol. Tonight a perfect pot of black Oolong tea was a great match to the cuisine. Faultless service, Delicious food, Great atmosphere. What else could you ask for?"

      "A friend recommended this place to us and said \"it's the best Banh Mi you'll ever have\" and he was not wrong! As we turned onto the street we saw two large queues - one was JUST for delivery drivers to pick up for take out/delivery, and one was for people on foot to takeaway. We knew from the queues it must be good! They don't have a menu as it's just one option - again - sign of someone who knows what they're doing vs a jack of all trades and master of none. Queue was big but wait wasn't long bas they have such a good system and production line going on in there! Can't remember exactly the cost but think around $3USD or something equally as cheap for what really could've been split between two not just for one person! They give you the bread with various cuts of meat with the pate and mayo wrapped up, and then little bags of the salad bits to add inside (1 x cucumber, 1 x pickled radishes, 1 x spring onions and herbs). I honestly can't describe how tasty the whole combo was! Gotta try it!",
      "The French bread, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, is crispier, fluffier, and softer than the real French bread, which seems to be due to the fact that Vietnamese bread is made from rice flour. I liked this better than the real French bread, which is filled with at least five different kinds of ham, pate, pork char siu, chicken ham, meat floss, onion chips, etc., and vegetables such as fresh cucumber, radish and carrot namasu, pak choi, green onion, fresh chilies, etc., are served separately and can be topped according to your preference. Vegetables such as fresh cucumber, radish, carrot, pak choi, green onion and fresh chili are served separately and can be topped as desired. The price is reasonable and the food is too good to be true."

      "Very delicious local food and great service. Super attentive and helpful. In particular Nu, an exceptional waitress. Everything is very clean and, in addition, a very very beautiful decoration of the land. Air conditioning is appreciated. Super attentive and different dishes: transparent lobster rolls, purple rice with shrimp and chicken with lemon sauce, highly recommended. This is the only reason I would go. And a delicious coffee. It is not the cheapest but the price is worth it. I recommend it.",
      "We decided almost at the end of our holiday. In Vietnam to treat ourselves to a dinner in one of the best and elegant restaurants in Saigon. The restaurant is located in the center, a stone's throw from the best hotels and tourist attractions of the city. The location, although a little dated, is very elegant with crystal booths with colored inlays. The menu includes typical local dishes with dishes not so dissimilar from others tasted in other restaurants, I ordered a classic as a starter, Fresh Rolls with prawns and pork followed by a duck breast cooked in two ways with tomato and pepper sauce with bok choi and smashed potatoes, both very elegant dishes and truly excellent on the palate. The service is absolutely professional, you are accompanied and followed right from the moment you enter the room. Naturally the prices are much higher than the Vietnamese average, absolutely normal for us Italians",
      "Having the opportunity to enjoy the anniversary special course dinner was truly wonderful. On previous visits to Vietnam, my schedule never aligned, so I was thrilled to finally seize the chance to dine there this time. Each course was a masterpiece, meticulously crafted and beautifully presented. While it wasn’t inexpensive compared to typical prices in Vietnam, I believe it was a unique and memorable experience worth every penny. The servers were highly professional and impeccably trained, contributing to what was, in every way, a perfect dining experience."

      "Perfect quiet restaurant amidst the hustle and bustle with extremely nice staff and very delicious food. I didn't know I ordered a dish to be rolled with rice paper, but my waiter Jack taught me that well. A clear recommendation !",
      "What a delightful surprise find this restaurant is! Fresh and delicious ingredients - the seafood! - at a ridiculously cheap price. Serving sizes are also very generous. The food more than compensates for basic surroundings. Limited English skills from the very hospitable staff counteracted by pointing at menu (in English and on website) and Google translator. Part of the adventure being the only non-locals there! After our first visit, we brought decent wine glasses and wine. No corkage, they provide an ice bucket. Perfection!",
      "This was our revisit after our last visit in 2019 (before Covid19) and that left us great impression and so decided to revisit again. The restaurant is located in De Tham street, where many family restaurants are located. If you are a first time visitor, you maybe spoiled for choice which restaurant to visit as all look \"good\"! For us, without hesitation, we went to this restaurant. And surprisingly it was quite empty although it was 7.30pm in the evening. Only 2 tables were occupied (on 2nd storey, including ours). Think Covid19 has hit hard on the small and medium businesses here. We ordered the pork ribs with fried rice, BBQ clams, stir fried cauliflowers and water spinach and deep fried chicken. We didn't order the BBQ oysters and beef dishes as we just had them the night before and wanted something \"light\". Portions were huge, And the food were yummy, well marinated and cooked to perfection, consistently good no doubt in that! And prices were reasonable too, despite of inflation, the price did not rise or rise slightly like 5000 dong only. Our dinner at around 220,000 dong. We didn't order any drink as we had plan to visit a cafe for iced beverages as the weather was warm. And it took us 10mins via Grab to get back to Saigon Center for our drinks then!"

Every visit feels special, like stepping into a familiar place filled with delicious food and heartfelt hospitality. The dim sum here is simply perfect—char siu bao is soft and flavorful, the pastries are crisp and golden, and every bite is crafted with authentic flavors. The service is truly five-star, with staff who are always welcoming and attentive, making us feel valued and at home. Whether for a celebration or a casual brunch, Libai never disappoints. It’s more than just a restaurant; it’s a cherished tradition where love, family, and great food come together. For the best dim sum in HCM, this is the place to be!",
      "The service of \"Man\" is good and today we had a nice night with family. Duck is delicious and the atmosphere is good. About $50 per person. Mega Members also enjoy a 10% discount. If you stay here, it is recommended to eat.",
      "A wonderful dim sum buffet. Lot of choice and amazing quality. Maybe the best one in HCMC. And quite affordable during the week. And if you are lost regarding the extended menu, the team can advise you on the dim sum relevant to your taste. And by the way, the main dishes, apart from the dim sum, are quite tasty too."

      "We dined at The Deck Saigon in Thao Dien recently and while the food was satisfying, we found the pricing and service to be disappointing. Despite being forewarned by some locals, my wife and I decided to give it a shot. The riverside seating offered a pleasant ambience, but the service left much to be desired. The main drawback here is the prices, considering that similar quality can be found with service to match. It wasn’t bad service, just inattentive and seemed to not know the menu. We are willing to give it another shot in the future to see if the experience improves. Everybody has off days.",
      "Well worth the short trip through the suburbs, The Deck offers a stunning example of intelligent \"fusion\" cuisine with a perfectly orchestrated mix of local (pancakes or spring rolls ) and Western classics ( carpaccios or ceviches). The impeccable service is in tune with the flawless freshness of all the products. Everything, including the bread and amuse-gueules, was delicious. The team in the kitchen got an unanimous approval from our group of six seasoned travellers who all chose different dishes. Surrounded by magnificent orchids, we enjoyed the peaceful view of Saigon River at our feet, as the meal progressed so smoothly that we forgot for a moment that Saïgon was re-baptized nearly 50 years ago. The Paris of the East is still well alive in many places across the city and this is definitely one of them . Heartfelt congratulations."

      "Have a chance to have lunch here with your family. The space is decorated modernly and luxuriously. My family ordered the set menu - Vietnamese food including 1 salad, 1 stir-fried vegetable, 3 salty dishes, 1 soup. The food is seasoned very well, the family really likes the braised fish dish - suitable for entertaining after the Tet season with braised eggs and meat. Seating space is available indoors and outside at noon, from evening outside, very suitable for romantic dates. The reception and service staff are very enthusiastic. My family and I went to the room that they helped us arrange to sit in the VIP room, and Duyen served our family wholeheartedly throughout the afternoon today.",
      "Last Saturday morning, my girlfriend and I went to have breakfast at ROS restaurant. We accidentally found out about the restaurant because we took the Water bus in District 1. The two of us ordered shrimp noodle soup and beef pho. The noodle soup is delicious, the broth is light, rich in shrimp flavor but a bit off for me. Beef pho is served in a stone bowl so the broth stays hot, has a strong flavor of cinnamon and anise, and is quite delicious. In particular, I find the milk coffee here delicious because I like to drink strong, sweet, bitter coffee. However, because the morning is quite sunny, I think sitting indoors will be cooler and less glare. If I have a chance, I will come back again.",
      "I came one afternoon waiting for my friends to start dinner. Since you haven't arrived yet, I decided to sit at the bar to enjoy a cocktail. Right at happy hour, it's only 89k per drink. The drinks recommended by the bartenders are very suitable to my taste, they are very enthusiastic and fun. After that, I moved to the river bank to have dinner. The food is delicious and unique, there is a slight minus point: I came on the weekend so I had to wait a bit but it's okay, the experience is still very good, the service people are very enthusiastic. Will come back in the near future."

During the day, as temperatures soar and the heavens threaten to open, Cafe de l’Opera becomes a refuge for travellers and the like, just as it always has been since the hotel doors opened in the 50s. Over high-tea, things slow down, friends catch-up, business associates meet and lovers hold hands. By night, things become lively again with tapas, cocktails and wine to the sounds of jazz and the excited chatter of guests enjoying an extended Happy Hour as the city comes alive again.",

I highly recommend visiting this gem in Saigon for a tranquil and inclusive environment that fosters connections.",

Coming here to drink morning coffee, eat a bowl of pho, read a newspaper and look at the street is something worth experiencing. They also have attentive friendly service.

      "Very tasty and well presented dishes served very competently by Oanh. Four diners shared veggie and other dishes and all were more than satisfied. Wine was reasonably priced and we enjoyed eating outdoors in this very busy restaurant. Hard to find but worth looking for.",
      "Been to this restaurant twice on a business trip. It's a little hard to find without special knowledge ) but eventually figured out the location. In the evening you usually need a reservation, but we were lucky and waited no more than 5 minutes . Good service, waiters give good advice on choosing and eating some special dishes. Pleasant atmosphere and interior. And of course, Asian food is delicious.",
      "We had the pleasure of dining at Hoa Túc during our recent trip to Ho Chi Minh City, and it was a fantastic experience. We believe we first visited this restaurant 25 years ago, and it’s just as impressive today! Set in a beautifully restored colonial building that once served as an opium refinery, Hoa Túc offers a charming atmosphere and a unique culinary experience. Their concept of “Vietnamese Cuisine with a Contemporary Twist” is both creative and authentic. The Food: • Starters: • Cá thác lác chiên giòn (Crispy featherback fish cakes): Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. • Bò lá lốt (Grilled minced beef wrapped in betel leaf): A standout dish, tender and packed with aromatic spices. • Mains: • Sườn non mật ong nướng (Grilled honey pork ribs): Sweet, savory, and perfectly tender, complemented by pickled shallots and lemongrass. • Cà tím xào sốt sa tế / Cà tím nướng (Eggplant with saté sauce / Grilled eggplant): Both variations were delicious, but the saté sauce added a delightful kick. The Service: The staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely welcoming, which enhanced our overall dining experience. Hoa Túc is a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the vibrant flavors of Vietnamese cuisine in a unique and historic setting. We can’t wait to return!"

      "We found Pasteur Street Craft Beer – Cưa Bắc Taproom & Restaurant on our first night in Hanoi, and ended up coming back multiple times! The beer is fantastic, and the food is just as impressive. They have 16 beers on tap—10 of their signature brews and 6 rotating seasonal options—so there’s always something new to try. On our first visit, I ordered a tasting flight of six beers and loved every single one. My favorites were the Pomelo IPA and the Passion Fruit Wheat Ale, and I could easily sip the Bia Chanh Muối (a low-alcohol salted lime beer) all day long. My husband, an IPA fan, really enjoyed the Session IPA, and we both loved the Double Jasmine IPA. David was incredibly friendly and helpful, encouraging us to explore the different styles and offering great suggestions along the way. The food was awesome, too! The menu is extensive, ranging from burgers and wings (both excellent!) to creative salads and dishes featuring Vietnamese ingredients. Even better—they sell their beer in affordable 1-liter growlers, so you can bring your favorites home. If you love craft beer and great food in a relaxed setting, this spot is a must-visit! If I could give Pasteur Street Craft Beer more than 5 stars, I would!",
      "So much life passing by, great beer...the Blonde was fab but sadly ran out. It would have been 5 stars but the nuts were crap. Sweet otatoe fries were battered but still tasty. Lovely staff.",
      "The atmosphere of this place is great, quite bustling and modern. Some of the beer flavors I tried were delicious. We also had some spicy chicken, which was great. The staff are also very friendly. Overall, this place is bang for our buck"

    "description": "Set in its original colonial décor from the 1920's, La Table du Chef is a subtle journey into fine crafts, paintings, culinary and winemaking arts sourced from Vietnam and France. In the same way that Hermès workshop was once defined as a song of gestures, lovers of haute cuisine are invited to hunt for traces left by the hand's gestures embedded into many aspects of the decoration of the restaurant. This story appealed to two Michelin-star chef Alain Dutournier who had selected La Table du Chef to bring his art of haute cuisine for the first time outside of France. He adheres so intimately to the concept that Alain now personifies the soul of La Table du Chef and his hands are the expression of the highest culinary art. Together with his talented Vietnamese Resident Chef, Dao Van Son, he brings to La Table du Chef the highest standard of excellence in French cuisine, with a touch of Vietnamese taste. In this artistic atmosphere, gastronomes will have a chance to discover an exceptional menu, highlighting the best local and imported products delivered daily, such as Foie Gras from Landes, Truffle from Perigord, Fleur de sel from Guerande, Duct from South Western France, Sapa's honey, Phu Quoc's pepper... These exquisite dishes are carefully paired with the most refined selection of wines to create a memorable culinary experience in the heart of Hanoi's French quarter. The very explanatory wine menu proposes 450 labels from most famous producers of the world, a majority of French wines, as well as wonderful discoveries from Alain Dutournier, all stored in the open cellar on site.",

      "As soon as arrived in Hanoi bt plane my family wanted to eat western food so I reserved lunch in La Table du Chef. As I expected the presentation was excellent and the food was delicious! There was a 3 course special lunch meal for 600,000 and it was more than you can expect for this price. The staff was friendly and offered an excellent desert dish for our son athough he did not order as he was tired and dizzy from his flight. I definitely recommend this to restaurant for a treat during your stay in Hanoi. (Note that it seemed around me there were mostly formal business luncheons and I regret i didn’t wear a more formal atire)"

      "Pho Bo restaurant has delicious and appetizing food, beef is added to the food quite a lot and it is delicious, the seasoning is seasoned to my taste. The broth is quite good and the side dishes are vegetables. They have ready-made spices for everyone to choose and add themselves. However, in my opinion, this restaurant is really not very comfortable, they should change other furniture and equipment and should clean it more. Really hard to choose it to come next time.",
      "We stopped here for lunch and enjoyed the chicken Pho which was excellent. At nearly 6 feet tall it was a struggle for me to sit on the tiny stalls - but sure was worth the effort! It was great to experience traditional food in a traditional no thrills setting. It's a must if you are in the Old Quarter and want some authentic fare. Thank you."

Food was all good: fresh sashimi, grilled saba fish, sushi (many different types of sushi).. Try the cordyceps mushroom hot pot and noodles that come with beef. Even the dessert greek yogurt (with pearl) was delicious. The menu is regularly refreshed with many dishes. Definitely worth a visit. Good value for $20 dinner set per person considering the food quality, service and restaurant setting.",
      "My partner and I were walking in the area and decided to stop at this lovely looking place for food. We were immediately charmed by the great ambiance, fresh sashimis, delicious tuna rolls, incredible service. A total gem!",
      "OMG I had such an amazing experience that I thought this place was a godsend. After visiting our relatives in Eco Park, my family needed something to eat for dinner. Then we stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. The place itself was rather small but tidy with lovely atmosphere. The service was excellent with very accommodating staff. As a sushi snob, I give this place my approval. The food was fresh, super authentic and delicious. The salmon avocado salad is to die for. The bathroom was clean too, so I undoubtedly rate this place a 10/10. So so good, thank you!"

      "I have read many good reviews about this place. I love “black bread” and here in Hanoi, it is hard to get good ones. I went there according to “less busy hour” on one of the web-sites (as I have read it is a busy place; the service may need to improve, etc), which was at 3 pm. As on their face book page, the working hour was from 11am to 10 pm, also having name” Cafe”, I could not believe a man who was their (seems the part of owner family) told me “in Vietnam, every restaurant must have lunch break” and told me to go back. The cafes in my neighborhood are open from the early morning to night, by the way.... “Weill then, please change, as your are open from 11 am to 2pm and 5 pm to 10 pm” as a kindness. At that moment, the lady of the restaurant said “since you have come here, we offer what we have”. Thanks to her, I was able to eat very good black bread and borscht. I have asked only to have black bread as I don’t eat white wheat and I did not them to waste any. But lady insisted. Funny thing is that a person who were in the kitchen quietly told me, “please do not worry, here, nothing would get wasted. This bread will be used as bread crumbs later.” Well... those who eat any fried cutlet, please keep that in mind... For the kindness of the lady, I give 4 stars."

Osaka is a land famous for culinary Kuidaore neighborhood, among them, typically cakes Okonomiyaki and grilled octopus Takoyaki . Currently, Okonomiyaki are specialties, won the love of not only the parts of the country throughout Japan but also foreign tourists. However, it is still considered unique culture, born from the soil of Osaka. Okonomiyaki plump cake, smear mayonnaise, sprinkle seaweed, fish tissue have great taste when enjoyed by Teko. For diners can enjoy delicious cuisine and attractive at Chibo, we always pay attention to the following factors: Mae aji, Naka AIJ, Ato aji, including: Mae aji impression about food and restaurants ; Naka aj: Taste cakes Okonomiyaki, Ato aji: Comment of the customer after eating and left the restaurant. We absolutely do not take any light of it at all! Okonomiyaki pancake dish was strange, not traditional Japanese cuisine, dishes nor Chinese, European dishes. It's great when everyone gathered around the grill, enjoy a hot Okonomiyaki cake, talking incessantly, creating a closed loop inside of the excitement, enthusiasm. We call it an Okonomiyaki conversation (Okonomiyaki communication) and really appreciate it.",

      "I can say Chibo is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Hanoi. Living in Hanoi for a few years, I visited many of the Japanese restarts that are highly recommened in many other webs and apps. Chibo has lots of different options you can choose from, noodles Okonomiyaki, and sushi. I actually order more than 5 menus to satisfy myself haha. I wanna give 5 stars or more if possible",
      "Favorite okonomiyaki in town. Great variety of option in the menu and all tasted amazing so far. Great place for family and children.",
      "Me and my partner been to Chibo in Osaka and had a very bad experience with their service. Now in Hanoi, we decided to give it another shot and were pleased with the experience. The staff is very polite and attentive, okonomiyaki is has a very authentic taste. We were seated in a private cabin so it was quite and cozy. A bit upset that they didn’t cook the food on our grill table, but rather brought a ready made okonomiyaki from the kitchen. But overall, we are happy. Will come back!"

      "My wife chose this place as a surprise to celebrate my birthday, and honestly I'm very glad she did. They have a good selection of the 2 mil vnd set menu, and the atmosphere was very cozy, although the pairing wine would have been a bit better. The best thing was after the meal, the restaurant manager found out that our bill was wrong (we didn't notice we were over charged cuz we were enjoying our time there), and she called my wife to offer a refund. That's what I called a very attentive and wholesome service. Well done guys! I'll be back for sure.",
      "My family of 4 recently had dinner at Studios and the experience was unforgettable. Every dishes has it own color but for me, I particularly enjoyed Pie Tee and Beef Tartare. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the ingredients were fresh and of high quality. The portion size was also perfect, leaving us comfortably full without feeling stuffed. The restaurant itself had a warm atmosphere. The music was at a pleasant volume, allowing us to easily converse. Will coming back and am really excited to see the new menu to try out",
      "The restaurant serves an artistic style combining cuisine and handmade drinks. This is the first time I have experienced this style. The quality of the food is nothing to criticize, and the pairing drinks are also excellent. Compared to such quality, the price is very reasonable. I will definitely come back often."

      "Little restaurant tucked away (sort of) and on the water at West Lake - away from the centre so quieter and cheaper…. Great, simple menu (ie not overfacing with too much complex choice, but hits all the right notes) Great drinks menu (had the first pisco sour I’ve seen out here - and it was excellent!!). Staff were attentive and knowledgable and could t have been the right side of friendly and without being intrusive. Food arrived quickly and was absolutely wonderful - large portions of fresh tasty fare. Would highly recommend",
      "What a find! Neat little place, with air on upstairs if needed. Tortilla chips while not made onsite come out warm, guac is really tasty though a touch more also and cilantro would be awesome. Tacos are excellent!",
      "I strongly recommend their shrimp taco. The tempura fish taco was really good also. A bit strange that they ran out all wine bottles in their list (all 20 kinda types of wines) so we had to buy a bottle at the warehouse nearby. They were nice not to charge us extra fee on outside drinks as usual so we ordered tequila also and it was good. Services was great. Nice ambient to sit outside by the lake. A bit disappointed that the ceviche was not as good as few years ago when they first opened on Tu Hoa."

      "Good coffee. Very friendly service. Spotlessly clean. Salads are outstanding, I tried 3 different ones over the course of my visit. Soup delicious. Western style coffee too. Very fair pricing for a “foreigner” place. I was able to ask for a mango smoothie made with fresh unsweetened milk instead of the usual sweetened condensed milk. Thanks.",
      "- The Food: Super duper awesome and worth the price. The sandwich is carried out in a proper manner with house chips. The menu is balanced and showcases a considerable depth in sandwich's lore. - The Drinks: Cool and do a good job paralleling the food. - Interior Design: It was cool. - Service's Attitude: It was cool. - Location: Somewhat sequestered to the corner, but has a wide space in compensation"

It's like a Vietnamese version of Five Guys or ShakeShack and building our own burgers was great and also cheap. Theres loads of options of what to put inside your burger/sauces/patty/bun as well. Great service and cute little location too. Also, if you visit here, get the rosemary and garlic fries!!! Would recommend for sure!",

A meal for two with a shared desert (we couldnâ€™t fit more into our tummies) and 2 non-alcoholic beverages set us back around VND 450K. Go check it out if you like your burgers and fries."

      "The bar is well placed in a quiet neighborhood. Still suffering the aftermath of the pandemic, need some refurbishment to offer such an Spaniard atmosphere, as the name suggests. Not much customers when we dropped by, Saturday noon. Dishes are small but tasty and well seasoned, bread is outstanding and his owner Rodrigo is a nice guy and used to be around and keeping an eye on everything.",
      "This made a nice change from local cuisine and was a treat. We ordered way too much food but is was all delicious, if ordering a meat platter this comes with bread already so best not to order more bread on the side as you end up with like a loaf, same with the alioli dip, pretty much everything came with this so ordering a side was unnecessary. The Spanish omelette was tasty, cheeae empnadias and mushroom croqueetes were good too. All of the food came out together and well presented, we just know to order less next time! The staff were super friendly and welcoming here also",
      "Great value for money and tasty food. Generous portions. Potatoes a bit too oily. Service staff look depressed, no smile and walking around very sad...owners must be in kitchen but service team need to cheer up."

      "I like the old fashioned. My wife got too many of the signature cocktails and she ran away with another man. I am currently trying to sway her back by brooding at the bar. No amount of cologne has helped.",
      "Classy atmosphere but with great energy. Went with my friends and we had such a fun night. If you are looking for an elegant and unique space (favorite design choice: the giant amber egg hanging overhead) and like grooving along to music from the DJ, it’s a must-try. The space feels cozy and lively. Enjoyable for many age groups.",
      "I went there with my best friends and had a great time. I love the ambience, decoration was impressive. The staffs were very nice and supportive. They managed to give us 2 seat without prior reservation. Overall a very nice experience!"

      "Great little find when we were out walking last night. The food was fresh and tasty for a great price. Service was excellent. We ordered a rice each and nan to share which was a mistake as one portion of rice was big enough for two of us and the nans were individual sized. We would recommend the chicken tikka masala. Will definitely go back before we go home.",
      "Wow, our meal here was absolutely delicious!! We ate the best butter chicken and garlic naan we have ever had!!! Rich and creamy sauce, tender fresh chicken and authentic spices and flavour!!! The rice was perfect and fluffy and the garlic naan was out of this world - cooked perfectly with the freshest garlic embedded in the bread and the dipping sauces took it all to the next level! The restaurant is just around the corner from Hanoi Beer St in the old quarter so a fantastic, vibrant area to wander through. The atmosphere inside and out was great! You can choose to sit outside or inside, ground floor or upstairs where the aircon was perfectly cool! A very high quality yet affordable meal (and drinks) with great service from lovely Indian and Vietnamese staff! If you feel like a change from Vietnamese food on your trip, this is a must try!!!",
      "YOU can’t Go Wrong with The Taj Indian and Vegetarian Restaurant. We started with the samosas which were flaky and not greasy. Nans were like pastry with a good selection of fillings. The vegetable masala was spicy deliciousness, and the spinach was smooth and flavorful. Mahdab, the owner was delightfully friendly and attentive. Priced and portioned for families. I highly recommend a visit at least once during your stay in the Old Quarter, Hanoi. It’s also on a street that is bustling with all sorts of candies, nuts and bottled booze! ENJOY ☺️"

You would find the Japanese family style restaurant. menu is extensive and I guess there are not few chinese or vietnamese mixed disks. the modest lunch sets for single customers are very popular. the foods are generally good. sashimis are quite fresh, mostly from local fish. the prices are on the above average side. the shop looks small outside but quite big inside and very busy at lunch time. better book your table in advance. note that all shoes off entering the shop.

      "Wonderful cooking class at Hao Sua, a vocational school designed to teach teens from poor villages a trade (sewing, embroidery, French cooking, Vietnamese cooking, baking, table service) then places them in local restaurants and hotels post-graduation. Started the day at the local market. Fresh vegetables, spices and meat. Seeing chickens in a cage was bothersome for my 13 year old son and my husband made sure he didn’t see chickens being killed. In retrospect, we should have asked our guide to avoid the meat section of the market although can’t get a more authentic experience. The ingredients for our food had already been bought but we picked up some mangosteen and vegetables. After a quick tour of the school, we made our way to the kitchen. Spent the morning making a delicious papaya salad, fresh spring rolls (rolling them perfectly is definitely an art) and grilled chicken. The chef guided us through the prep and cooking process. After we finished, we sat down at a beautifully set table to our feast. One of the best meals we had on our trip thanks to a great chef. Highly recommend this class as family fun and a great way to learn about Vietnamese food."

      "We ordered from this place a number of times while we were in lock-down for COVID. The food was so good that I really wanted to visit and eat in the restaurant itself. The ambiance isn't much. The dining room is quite small and because it's all concrete, the loud party next to us was quite annoying. And, we saw some of the kitchen staff smoking in the kitchen. Perhaps that's OK in Vietnam but for a westerner, it's a bit of a turn-off. Either way, the food was good. Yes, most of my friends prefer Pizza Belga but I find Belga to be overpriced and \"under-cheesed\" if that's a word. We actually really enjoyed everything we got from Paolo and I hope to return soon.",

      "we eventually got to try Iroha ramen after they opened again after being closed over the recent Tet new year celebrations and it was definitely worth the wait. One of my favourite restaurant dishes is Ramen and having tasted ramen in 5 of the 7 continents I certainly rate Iroha up there with some of the best outside of Japan. The broth was both flavoursome and not too salty, with a nice selection of ingredients. This is a highly recommended ramen restaurant.",
      "Was looking for a quality ramen 🍜 place in Hanoi and stumbled upon Iroha after looking it up. Arrived right after they re-opened for the dinner service, so had the place entirely to myself. The staff were second to none and they were extremely attentive and courteous. Food-wise, I went for the Miso Ramen, which was as good a bowl I could have hoped for. Noodles were spot-on, broth was great, the pork slices were tender and flavorful, and the egg yolk was just as it should be with a gorgeous consistency. Price was a bit high by local standards, but well-worth it if you’re craving the good stuff like it is back in Japan. As someone who lives in this city, I’ll definitely come back for more."

It was not tasty and also ratio of value for money did not exist. They have portraits of many dignitaries who are in this place but perhaps it was a good restaurant in the past. The only highlight for me was life music performance",

      "We happened to walk by this place and thought we saw a sign for Che Thai (Thai fruit dessert) so we came in. Turned out they didn’t have it. But we’re glad we sat down because the coffee is sooo good! Dark and strong and sweet, what real Viet coffee should taste like. I think this is more of a local spot, but if you want strong Viet coffee this is one of the spots to check out (they don’t have egg coffee though, but quite a selection of drinks and dessert drinks. And it’s at a busy intersection so you can sit and enjoy the traffic and people watching.",

The quality of the fresh ingredients (morilles and cepes mushrooms, Japanese wagyu beef etc) was just outstanding. We were brought a whole plate of fresh morilles which are extremely expensive. We were amazed by the profusion of high quality ingredients specially in such quantities for each customer. The resulting hotpot was... Well... The best I have ever had. It was not cheap but certainly worth more than we were charged. Highly recommended",

      "My husband and I had a fabulous seafood dinner at this restaurant during our visit to Hanoi last week. The staff did not speak much English but they were friendly and helpful. We had 2 seafood dishes, the crab in sour sauce and mantis shrimp with garlic and butter and both dishes were excellent. Sauteed morning glory and seafood with glass noodle were both also very tasty. The best part was that they had a promotion for week night dining which made the meal very reasonable (even our tour guide thought so). This restaurant is located a bit away from the main tourist area in the old quarter but definitely worth the trip to get there."

      "Lovely little place in Hanoi - a place with a sophisticated European feel in the hustle & bustle of Hanoi Old Town. We visited a couple of times, once on a Wednesday which is Jazz night - beautiful soft jazz, not too loud, gave the place a lovely atmosphere. Would recommend if in Hanoi Old town - good wines, & though not extensive, the menu has a good selection - can certainly recommend the cheese board. Hope it continues to thrive!",
      "Nice wine bar with a very good selection of wines, delicious cheese and very fresh, crispy baguettes. The music is tailored to European tastes and fits perfectly in this bar. Everything is very pleasant and atmospheric. The bubbling sound with which mucus is drawn up from the nose into the throat is certainly not one of the more pleasant acoustic experiences. Unfortunately, the young bartender doesn't know this and is constantly busy with his slime, which is especially disgusting when you are eating. Unfortunately, the staff is not very friendly to the guests. We were here practically every evening during our stay in Hanoi and the behavior hasn't changed. It's a shame, we would expect that at this price level and in a bar that is obviously aimed at European customers.",
      "This is a proper wine bar in Hanoi. A range of red and white wines by the glass and an extensive wine by the bottle list. Happy hour 4pm to 7 pm with 30% reduction was sadly missed by us but fir top quality wines this is still a great venue The cheese plate was substantial and will be easily sufficient for two Don’t miss Ajax Wednesday. Soft mellow jazz beautifully song and played by two local musicians. Overall this is a place to plan into any trip to Hanoi"

The picturesque lakeside setting and view of Hoan Kiem Lake were certainly major draws for this property. The quality of drinks and food was acceptable, but not exceptional. However, the main negative was the price. I found that the prices were a little too high compared to the quality of the products offered. It's important to note that prices shown on the card do not include taxes and service fees, which may result in a final bill that is higher than expected. The service at Thuy Ta cafe was OK, but not particularly attentive. I would have appreciated an additional touch of friendliness to make the experience more pleasant. Despite these drawbacks, the lakeside location was lovely, and the place was conducive to relaxation. It's a nice place to have a coffee or a snack while enjoying the beautiful view of the lake.",
      "Beside good service and tasty vietnamese food, this restaurant is “must visit” place in Hanoi due to its location! I love the view toward Hoan Kiem Lake! Amazing"

The The food was good, my suggestion is to stick to the salads, appetizers and pizza. The service is very good, staff there were very friendly. Check it out.",
      "Interesting and fun place.. A pool table for added fun. There’s plenty of space to sit outside surrounded with greenery. We had pizza & fries which were tasty.",
      "This place was a great find whilst here in Hanoi with my work for 6 weeks. Thursday nights they do mussels in a fantastic tomato and garlic baste - very tasty. They do wood fired pizzas and various other foods, which are delicious. Not local Viet food, but not over priced either. Very friendly team there and always happy to help. We went on Thursday night 19/12 for mussels. Last night for pizza and beers. We will be back tonight again."

      "We went to the Oak Wine Boutique yesterday. Love that the entrance is down an alley and up some stairs. We sat on the balcony above the fray and enjoyed a glass of white wine while the city bustled below. Some friends joined us for dinner- lamb chops, steak and noodles shared between us - and of course more wine. The service was great, very friendly and just close enough. Also the music was so nice, all of us remarked on it - jazz, but did not compete with the conversation. ☺️"

We were very pleasantly surprised by how friendly the service was and how tasty our pizzas were! It was a hit! We can recommend the \"Paolo & Chi Pizzeria\" without hesitation.",

      "This is an amazing experience in a special place that looks more like a living room than a commercial restaurant. 10 minutes taxi ride from the old city, this is a residential area and the restaurant is hided behing a wall that conceals a beautiful garden and villa. We sat at the bar which allows for full view of what happens in the open kitchen. The tasting menu is balanced, very special and based on local produce and Vietnamese ingredients. Everything was so beautifully presented and the taste was always subtle and yet exciting. The price is also friendly for what you get so it is a highly recommended experience when in Hanoi. DONT MISS IT !",

Had I ordered both the pizza and pasta, it would have been far too much food.  The salad bar was incompletely stocked at 1:30 PM but what I found was good.  The \"spaghetti bolognaise\" didn't taste a bit like what you'd find in Italy and had a tomato-based sauce that resembled what would come from a bottle of Ragu.  My partner had a BBQ beef pizza that was \"okay.\"  The total bill with two bottled waters was 387,720 VND (about $16).\n\nDespite only an average experience at lunch, the easy option appealed to us again several days later for dinner.  We split a large Hawaiian pizza that was good but not great.  With three local beers, the charge was 337,000 VND (about $14).  Service for both meals was good but not polished.  We sensed tension between the wait staff and their manager.\n\nThe menu is extensive and extends far beyond pasta and pizza.  The other diners were mostly local, and at dinner included families enjoying huge platters of ribs and other western items.

The 2nd visit, we ordered the large split(Hawaiian/Marinara) thin crust pizza, Lime Drink, Zero Heiniken, then caramel dessert and apple crisp with ice cream. Excellent food and service with both bills under $19. Noise level is high especially with families on the weekends.",

      "Really great place. We came here by a group of 4 hugry people after 8h of walking around city and we recived even to much food to eat all of it. Prices are really fair, from my point of view, and personel is really friendly. Only one thing to notice - noodles = soup, but it was great, so who cares XD",
      "We went twice it was that good, owner is so so so lovely gave us free bananas as dessert. Food was great, we had the steamed chicken both times it was that delicious. Good prices too compared to similar places around the old quarter and very generous portions. Cafe is small and cozy sealed off from the busy road so less noise, good air con, very clean. In summary just eat all your meals in Hanoi here",
      "We had walked around trying to find a small cafe restaurant that wasn’t eating on the side of the road. They were friendly, good the best we had whilst on our stay in Hanoi and with wifi and a good fan, it was perfect. We ate bbq pork and seafood dishes with noodles"

      "5 minute walk from both the Sheraton and Intercontinental hotels. The food quality, selection, and presentation are excellent. The prices are extremely reasonable. We started with duck pate matched with a variety of breads. We were served an amuse bûche of beef relish. Hummus was provided to go with the bread baskets. I ordered a set menu of spring rolls, duck confit, and crème brûlée. My partner ordered the fish and panna cotta. We loved everything. They have an extensive wine cellar, VERY reasonably priced. The meal was excellent and the staff were very attentive and engaging with a good command of English. The decor is beautiful - brick walls with a selection of modern paintings. We had a table by a very large window so we could watch Hanoi nightlife while we ate. I recommend the Vine to anybody staying in the area."

      "I visited the branch in Hanoi for a quick lunchtime snack and I sat at the bar. The atmosphere was decent, probably very cool for a romantic nighttime meal. Prices are relatively high for such in Hanoi but compared to Western prices it is pretty cheap. Food quality is good and fresh. I personally like the chefs to wear gloves so that their skin does not touch my raw fish, although I am well aware of the for and agains on this.... Still, if you like the gloves ON this is not necessarily the place for you. They bring very small amounts of ginger and they served no wasabi which I thought a tad strange, although to be fair - when I asked they did bring what I needed very fast. Services is distant but decent. The place is worth a visit.",
      "Was there with my family twice in January 2017 and May 2017. The ambiance was great and the service was decent. The food was alright, nothing spectacular though. To sum it up, the quality of the food does not match the price and I think there are better Japanese places to put your money."

      "Got back to Hanoi late after a day trip and the restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed. Walked around the corner and found Gecko. It's a find! I think I had ribs with mashed potato (of all things!) and the potato was the best I had ever tasted, really! My friends had a rice dish and a noodle dish which were all really tasty and the cost was amazingly low. We had beers too. Sadly it was our last night in Hanoi or we would have returned to sample the other dishes on the menu. The staff were friendly and the delivery of the dishes was prompt. Really great place to eat in Hanoi, and easily found.",
      "I had the chicken and sweetcorn soup which was nice and creamy, although it didnt come with bread so had to pay extra for that. My boyfriend ordered meatballs which came with rice, the sauce was more like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce and he found it too sugary and salty so didnt eat much. We both enjoyed our shakes though."

We ordered the classic dim sum dishes with a vegetable stir fry and sweet and sour pork - all delicious! I would most certainly recommend this restaurant for those seeking an alternative cuisine in Hanoi!",
      "We been there before on normal days they serve the dimsum in the chinese restaurant. This time we went for their buffet Dimsum and they have alot more choices spread over the open area on 2nd floor. They serve and go around using the traditional carts and the food quality is still good! Will definitely be back again.",

      "Right from the entrance one is made welcome and relaxed. Was introduced to available snakes. The cobra supposidely tastier is much bigger enough for several people. I chose the Bamboo snake small enough for one person. You get to see the culling including swollowing the beating heart infused in snake blood Vodka. Several shots of that and the eight course meal kept coming. Couldn't eat the whole thing but a worthwhile Experince 3.5 for me",
      "We just wandered here on our own a little after lunch time as the last of the customers were leaving and staff had already started cleaning yet they were ready to serve us. There was a lone English speaking staff who explained the process. We opted for a cobra which was cooked into 10 different dishes. The blood n bile were mixed with rice wine to have as shots. Food was tasty and service was ok. The only thing amiss was the heart was not still beating when being served. A little tricky to find. We booked an uber and asked the staff to explain the address. The uber guy cancelled - the reason could be the alleys or maybe the staff wanted to arrange their transporation...finally we walked out onto the main street and booked another uber."

      "We ordered the sous vide rib eye steak . Instead of the blue cheese sauce we asked for black pepper sauce. No problem. We had the best , juicy steak I have had for a long time. It was cooked to perfection - medium rare and the grill marks added extra flavor. Fabulous. It came with some small potatoes and a tiny carrot. A few more vegetables would have been ideal. The white Riojas wine was outstanding. Little acidity. It was quiet in the restaurant that it was easy to talk. Service was excellent. Could not fault. Can recommend",
      "I think \"Casa Espana\" is the best Spanish restaurant in Hanoi. Lunch set menu (attached photo) was reasonable price and each dishes were very tasty. I tried other set menu as well and they served us cold cuts board, 3 tapas and main dish. If you will go there, I recommend you to drink Barcelona Beer at same time. Enjoyed their food and atmosphere, that's why I give them 5* rating. Thanks Casa Espana."

      "A very good Japanese restaurant, not for all budgets but so good. Very warm welcome, the cuisine is simply perfect and fresh, the chef explains each dish to you in English. I recommend it, if you like Japanese cuisine, go there with your eyes closed",
      "What an incredible Japanese dinner, an artwork of food. The chefs were precise and thoughtful preparing everything before our eyes with presentation you could only dream of. The master chef went out of his way to describe the dishes and ingredients in his best English too. Many raw fish and egg dishes, exquisite flavours. The staff were attentive. Dinner was fine dining, $300 AUD for two. Our international Mastercard did not work in their eftpos machine and so we then paid cash, but the attitude to the eftpos error (out of our control) was not pleasant for us. An unfortunate end to an incredible experience. I do recommend going but encourage taking cash.",
      "This place was amazing, and not only for the food. We ordered the omakase and were treated to a lavish and elegant feast with over the top presentations of each course. My friend paid for the meal and I paid for a pricey bottle of sake. We couldn’t finish all the sake but we put enough of a dent in it that I was definitely tipsy by the end of the meal. I meant to leave fifteen dollars over the service charge as tip but mixed up the bills and left $80 instead. I only discovered this when I returned to my hotel. I was annoyed with myself but I didn’t think there was anything I could do. The next day, I was wandering around Hanoi rather aimlessly and I found myself in front of the restaurant. I thought, why not? And I politely told them I thought I had left too much money the previous night. They immediately said yes, I had. And they promptly returned the money I had given them minus the amount I had intended to tip them. I gave them half that amount again for being so honest and kind. I apologized for my mistake but they assured me it was okay. They have certainly earned the tip, the 5 stars, and my gratitude."

We tried the beef and cheese rolls, beef steak with mushrooms, chef’s salad, Al Fresco salad, and the chocolate brownie with ice cream. Strongly recommend. Very kind and precise staff with very good understanding of English (unlike some other places).",
      "Delicious pizza! I've eaten at Domino's and Pizza company and found Alfresco's food to be a bit better than the above two restaurants. The space is clean and has a bit of a restaurant feel. There are also often promotions of 99k. Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't have as many facilities as other pizzerias"

      "Came here for a social group gathering as it was arranged for the group to have twas and coffees upstairs. This was my first visit and the restaurant is delightful, very well decorated and welcoming staff. We were fortunate enough to have a welcome from the restaurant manager who clearly has a high passion for his work and in particular tea, will be returning for a tea tasting session for sure. The upstairs had a large open patio balcony area and was very chic in design. You could also peel at the open kitchen as you walked down to the ground floor. Looking forward to returning",
      "Enjoyable dinner time alone. Very friendly waiter always with warm smile on face. Also introduce the better view on roof top, but a abit hot for me eventually i stayed indoor. Very nice food in reasonable price. Fancy dish arrangement as well. Perfect portion size for me. I ordered: Green salad Salmon tartar Onion rings Mojitos All good! Unfortunately not able to take any images having non stop facetime call with my hubby 🙈 Definitely will go again for next stay. ==================================== 但點解要我打中文呢…. 明明打好晒英文但唔計字數，係要我寫無聊50字呀。 呢間係幾舒服，今日晚機走，依家check out 完都會過去坐下先過機場",

Weds they have a happy hour(s) menu which is longer for the ladies, this was a great opportunity to sample a few of the wines in one evening.

They decided to make it specially for him. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who visits Hanoi.",

      "I was visiting museums around the Opera House and looking for a place for lunch. This place wasn't actually on my radar, I was looking out for a couple of other highly-rated restaurants when I saw this place. It looked good from the outside, so I went in. This restaurant didn't disappoint. The food was every bit as good as in any good Japanese restaurant I've been to (and there have been quite a few, both in Japan and outside). I was a little bit hesitant ordering the fish bento, being unsure about the quality of sashimi in Hanoi. But the sashimi was totally fresh and well-prepared, as good as any sashimi I've tried. Importantly, they have a very good sake list, with plenty of options available in 180 and 300 mL flasks. It was a most delightful lunch that made my museum tour that extra bit more fun. By the way, the location of this restaurant is slightly mis-labelled on the map: It is actually right at the side of the large square building with an internal courtyard housing the History Museum.",
      "Last week, I came here on sunday night. The restaurant was crowded. So lucky that we meet the server staff who was kind and enthusiastic . Though the restaurant was crowded, the staff was still willing to help us to order menu and recommend delicous food. We waited a long time, however they were sorry to have kept us waiting. It is so nice! Food is so good I love japanese food I love your restaurant",
      "I love your restaurant so much I came here to be drunk with my friends. The atmosphere is animated and your food is so yummy. The staff is enthusiastic Recommendation for you who want to find a chill space Let the music runs to you Let the alcohol flows into you Sit and enjoy all !!!"

      "Clean, tasty, genuine home cooked food. My husband and son eat meat so weren’t as enthusiastic as me about going vegan. To their total delight they loved their meals as much as me! The pho was outstanding - rich flavours with tofu/tempeh and rice noodles that appeared to be homemade rather than mass produced. The spring rolls were equally flavoursome, crispy and not too oily. We also had a plate a perfectly ripe jackfruit for dessert . Great service . Good quality food . Highly recommend.",
      "By coincidence, passing to see West lake, we saw vegan choice for lunch. Small street restaurant, friendly owner, decent offer. Ambience is not super nice but taste and offer was good and interesting and enjoyed it. Ordered noodle soup, steamed rice with veggies and fried spring rolls. Recommended",
      "Our favorite restaurant in Hanoi. The vegan food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We had a Pho dishes which featured various vegan meats and a noodle dish. As we would be on the road the next day, we ordered strips of fried fake meat which was perfect for our packed lunch. Wish we could have tried everything!"

Suitable for a formal business meeting as well as casual gathering for there are so many private rooms including VIP room which will guarantee your companies an impressive moments. Surely no more words for the food. Exactly the authentic taste of Korea - and you should try pyeongyang langmyeon(cold soup noodle) which is a nice desert-like food after having rich BBQ meal. Restaurant itself is also very clean - which I really think is important.",

In my opinion, this restaurant is good for you to welcome the foreigner customer, the dishes here is definitely Vietnamse style, it makes the foreinger feel exciting and eager to taste the food. I can see the comfort in my business customer's eyes whenever I had dinner with them here. Finally, the price is expensive, just for business purpose.",
      "We came for an early dinner about 6pm and prior to going in we checked regarding Pho and they confirmed they had it and the quantity of meat roughly in each bowl. When we were seated and decided our meal, the waitress took our order and brought us our drinks and then later came and said that they ran out of Pho soup!! I am not sure how a restaurant of this size could run out of Pho soup at 6pm!! On top of this they could not offer pineapple juice even though it is on the menu. We ended up ordering pork chops but the meat was all cut up and was quite dry - very disappointing. The restaurant looked quite nice but food was very average and on the pricey side."

      "Six of us staying at the Hanoi-Sofitel Legend Metropole wanted a Vietnamese restaurant close by for our first night in Hanoi. Club Opera Novel was on the hotel recommended list so we all tried it. There is a nice ambience in the restaurant and a couple of the wait staff spoke English. The Fried Spring rolls were a great surprise and were served pegged by toothpick to a hollowed out pineapple illuminated by a candle beneath. The rolls were outstanding and crunchy. I highly recommend this appetizer! I had the fried sea bass which turned out to be fish medallions fried with a nice sauce. It was just okay. My other friend chose the steamed Grouper in tea leaves which she enjoyed. As a side we ordered the eggplant which I thought had too much sauce. Nevertheless the eggplant tasted good. In summary, this is s good restaurant with a good variety. The only issue I had was that four of us received their dinner but mine took another 15 min. Prices are 4 star but the quality is good.",
      "We ate here twice during our brief stay in Hanoi. The first time was lunch and we were the only people in there. We tried the spring rolls (crab/pork) and the Imperial style, pho, glass noodle with crab and Australian beef stir fry. Then for dinner with another couple and once again everything was delicious. Service was lovely too."

      "Found by chance and ordered chicken noodles and shrip fried rice with a Hanoi beer and diet coke. Food came steaming hot from the kitchen, served with a smile and tasted great. Sjrimps like king prawns and chicken super tender. Came to £8.50! Enough for 2 to share. Highly recommended!",
      "We found this great family run restaurant just off the night market. It offers excellent value for money and all the dishes we tried were wonderful and full of flavour. Service was quick and friendly. I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointed.",
      "The servings are a good size and great value. The shredded chicken salad comes with peanuts on top and was delicious. Sometimes the service was great but one time we ordered 2 dishes, only 1 turned up and when we asked about the 2nd it still didn't turn up so we gave up and left. Still worth going again then we discovered another V-Cuisine just around the corner (29 P. Hàng Giầy, Hàng Buồm, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội, Vietnam) with the same menu and more reliable service."

We ordered a few different dishes and each one was delicious! The crab pasta here makes me impressed. It’s the first time we tried to eat a whole crab, even its skin. It’s fantastically delicious and I really liked it. Highly recommend!",
      "We really enjoyed our fine dining here. Food and wine all lovely and well cooked. We especially loved the squid dish and the yummy chocolate lava cake. Only downside was they didn’t serve tea or coffee after the meal which is quite a disappointment as we had to leave and go to another cafe just for a meal end drink!"

In addition, the shop also sells egg coffee that I always want to try. At first, I thought putting eggs in the coffee would have a fishy smell, but it's not fishy, it's quite fragrant, a unique flavor. I also saw the shop listed in the menu of chrysanthemum tea drinks, they put dried chrysanthemums and a few other ingredients I don't know what it is but it looks very beautiful and luxurious.",

    "description": "In our group there were trip members who prefer Indian food even during travelling abroad. Aahar was the answer and this eatery was just few meters away from our hotel. So, we ordered and enjoyed butter and garlic nan, dal makhani, panner tikka, butter chicken, mixed vegetable, and what not. All the group members enjoyed quality and tasty typical Indian style dishes thoroughly. Finally, we'd masala tea to wrap the session. It was truly a pleasant experience not just for the quality of food and ambiance, but also service of staff. Sensed they try their best to satisfy travelers. Price is also reasonable and so South Asian tourists should try this place for having quality food of their own taste.",

      "The garlic naan was truly delicious, hot and piping, paired perfectly with the rich flavors of paneer butter masala and fried rice. During the rainy season, the masala chai at this place felt like a true blessing. Conversation with the restaurant owner added a special touch to the overall experience. Dining here was really enjoyable!",
      "Aahaar restaurant, located in Old Quarters of Hanoi, gives you an experience of Indian food away from home. Since this restaurant was near our hotel, we used to visit it when craving home food. The quality of the food is excellent both in taste and presentation. They maintain perfect hygiene. The lady who runs the restaurant, Lan, is very hospitable and enquires at each table about the well being of guests. Even the price is reasonable. Try their daal fry, rolls, chicken curry, naan and keema matar."

      "My husband and I were so lucky to find this Bánh Mì place in Hanoi's Old Quarter. It is a little off the beaten track and we only happened onto it while shopping for traditional Vietnamese sweets across the street. We tried two different types of Bánh Mì which were both delicious as I am sure everything else is in this restaurant. All ingredients are fresh and tasty. The shop owner is very nice as is her son who speaks English and who sometimes helps out his mother. I hope to go back one day to try the other things on the menu. There are other Bánh Mì places closer to the cathedral, but this one is by far superior.",
      "this is my first experience about banh mi. it was so good, the bread is so soft and other toppings are perfect. and I had 2 drinks cuz so hot weather, they are nice too. avocado rich taste and kind of lemon things make me feel fresh. also very nice staff who can speak English so well.",
      "This is the best banh mi in Hanoi for me! I’ve tried Banh Mi 25 as it’s super hyped up by others and while Banh Mi 25 is good, Banh Mi Vui beats them when it comes to toppings and quite frankly Banh Mi Vui tastes just as good if not even better than Banh Mi 25. Also, their milk iced coffee is the best! Definitely my favorite banh mi and iced coffee in Hanoi. If you’re reading this review please come and try it. I love their beef with mozzarela cheese banh mi."

We were shown to our table by a young girl who had limited English and saw only one other person the whole evening - a young lad that came in and went upstairs to what I presume was the kitchen and then wandered back outside again. We had the honey chicken having read about it on TA but this was thigh chicken and most of the flavour was on the skin which I don't often eat so lacking in taste for me. Had sticky rice which was okay but nothing special. We had spring rolls to start - a few small pieces in very nice sauce though. Finished with banana fritters which were lovely - in syrup with peanuts. Whole meal was 410,000 VD. There was no atmosphere and the girl spent the whole night on her mobile phone texting and talking. We were there about an hour and were really disappointed.",

      "I came here many years ago and had the best chicken I had ever eaten. After seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's show, I was fortunate to come and try the chicken cooked by madam Tuyet herself. Unfortunately now the charm has gone. It's still run by the Tuyet family but clearly the desire to be the best is not as important now and the restaurant is empty. Such a pity. I hope they read trip advisor and take this as constructive feedback. The same chicken I ordered years ago that I have told so many people was the best ever is now just ok.",
      "Another great recommendation that we got. Went here and found the place. The entrance (and walk up to the restaurant) isn't much but the food was great. We asked for suggestions and the choices were great. A must visit."

      "GREAT PIZZA AND BEER!!!! This place is legit; granted we’re going back to Cali tomorrow after 4 weeks-in SE Asia are missing the home cookin but this place was sooo good. Solid diversity of beers, Fire Starter is awesome, and the pizza is excellent. We got the 50 cm pie and the crust was nice and thin; perfect for folding! Staff is super friendly, the only challenge was crossing the street😜.",
      "I went there with my friends to relax and have a good talk. The restaurant has a very relaxing ambiance and the beer taste really good. You should not forget to try their pizza. Their staffs are really friendly and very accommodating. The staff who order from our table is a really nice staff and he makes sure that you feel comfortable and that they gave everything we asked for. Here are some pictures of me and my friends with the staff, his name is Denver from what I remember.",
      "I've gone here and ordered home a bunch of times. The food is GREAT. The drink selection is awesome. More importantly, the service is absolutely spot on. The waitresses and waiters that work there are extremely pleasant, polite and attentive. Definitely check out this spot if you're looking for good food and drinks. It's a great place to meet up with friends. I'll definitely be going back."

      "If you've had your fill of pho, bahn mi, bun cha and other Vietnamese delights then this place offers a welcome break. The Tom Yum was creamy and not so spicy while the serving size was just right. The beef curry had some tough pieces but was quite okay. Closer to a saucy rendang than to a hot Thai curry in flavor. The Pad Thai was the best dish. Service was prompt and English was passable. Will certainly be back if I am in Hanoi.",
      "Perhaps the best place for Thai food in Hanoi. Really like how the food taste here, flavourful, rich but not overly spicy. There are many must-try dishes, namely, grilled iberico pork, soft shell crab, padthai, durian creme brulee. Offering good value for money that definitely worth a visit.",

      "Great location and really pleasant owner who will chat with you if you want too. Reasonable prices. Although I did not eat here some others at my hotel said the food was good. After a couple of weeks of oriental food nice to finish off with a steak"

Succulent and melted in the mouth. Red wine was beautiful and dinner very price friendly. Staff were excellent. Toilet very clean.",
      "I came across this restaurant because it's located next to the hotel where I was staying, and I found it on Tripadvisor, although it didn’t have many reviews. It turned out to be a real surprise! The food was absolutely delicious and offered a great variety. We ordered a set for two people, which included a mix of different dishes. We came back again on our last day in Hanoi, and this time I tried their white sangria, which was really good. We also ordered a few more dishes, and they were all fantastic.

You sit mainly at the bar which is perfectly fine as you can watch the chefs make your delights. There were two sit down tables but they were busy. Just go!",
      "We all decided to have ramen for dinner and after reviewing ramen restaurants in Yelp in Old Quarter of Ha Nôi, we selected Yukichi Ramen. Well, we got LUCKY!!!!!! Yukichi offers 3 type of ramen noodles: thin, medium, large size. I love thin noodles because you get to taste the softness and flavorful noodles and the richness of the soup stock. The quail eggs inside the bowl of ramen added a sweet richness to complement the noodles but not taking away from the flavorful richness of the pork soup stock. The potstickers were good but don't forget to add a little of red vinager, sesame oil & palm sugar to their dipping sauce because it was too salty for me. Beside that, this is an amazing spot for ramen. Thank you for not over-charged your ramen noodles like the other ramen restaurants!!!!!"

Eel rice has rich flavor and delicious rice grains. Need to book a table because the restaurant is very crowded, and there are discounts.",

      "Went to his restaurant after a tiresome day to have some delicious food. but we did not enjoy the food so much. The service was great but personally didn't like the food preparation.",
      "This restaurant is quite clean and comfortable, the staff are friendly but food is bit quite expensive. Beside this there are some more halal restaurants in Hanoi, one nearby in Hàng Bè street, No.92 Le Duan street n some more... Those who want to buy Baju kurung, jubah, telekung and other stuff for muslim may contact murahborongvietnam.com. There design is quite nice and cheap. They have a shop in Ho Chi Minh and just opened one branch in Ha Noi. Luckily the guide took me to there shop on the 1st day the shop was opened so I got some discount.",
      "Now called Little India, this restaurant had a diverse menu (written in English), including a large vegetarian section. 4 of us were very pleased with our meal. The service was good, and the place was clearly overseen by a short Indian man who swung by our table, made sure our meal was good, and asked us where we were all from. The atmosphere was okay. (A little music would have been nice, and distracted from the city and kitchen sounds). Highly recommended."

Local Vietnamese cuisine we dined on an endless sea of plates Very unique experience and a must go",
      "I came here as a guest and we had a private (air conditioned) room in the garden area. The ambiance is very good and the staff treat you like a king. We had traditional Vietnamese food, which wasn't entirely to my taste but I could taste it was fresh and cooked to perfection. Really top class.",
      "From the look the restaurant is a fancy one. It serve traditional vietnamese dishes and capable to serve more than 200 guesses at once. The food is okay.. The restaurant serve more seafoods then any other food type. Maybe becouse seafood is a hits in hanoi as a seaside country. During the meal it also provide live music performing traditional instruments played by girls. Very nice place.. Good food. Suitable for big groups dining."

They were not interested in changing anything insisting they were different teas. Clearly they were the same! Also charged 15000 dong for about 20 ml of milk which curdled in the ‘black’ tea because it was actually a lemon tea!!! Customer service needs a little work! Lovely clean space to hang out."

      "Clean, attentive staff & good food. This place is around the corner from our hotel Hilton Garden Inn. Super easy to walk to with English menu. The food is something we have eaten at the home of my Vietnamese friend back in the states. It was a wonderful experience to have in Hanoi. A nice variety from the soup noodles and rice dishes. The staff was attentive especially the woman there (sorry lost the sheet of paper with her name that we wrote down) who helped us select the dishes and gave us an extra lettuce basket. Also watched her really cleaned up the tables/ chairs & set up the tables. Just wish there was AC but most places in Hanoi do not have AC.",
      "One of the better places to break away from also tasty street food in the neighbourhood. It was recommended by our local friends. Friendly staff. Prices are reasonable for the food quantity, quality, presentation and taste. So order something extra you won't get elsewhere.",
      "Really pleased I got a recommendation from a local for this restaurant. Excellent food !! Tipical regional dishes on the menu. Happy we got some explanation how to make te combination with the dishes being served. Very kind and pleasant people. Happy to be a bit away from the touristic track and find these authentic dishes. Definitely recommended. Our best restaurant we found in hanoi."

      "- Tasty mexico dishes. Highly recommend for a lovely dinner. Romantic and attractive. Love Mexico and Latino",
      "Just to clear that up as I see many comments here about Mexican food. The food is Latin, and as such is very good. I had the ham and Chorizo as a starter. Not cheap but that was expected as the cold cuts are imported. The ham regrettably was straight out of the freezer and still had pieces of ice stuck to it. The main course, chicken with black rice was pretty good though it could have used a little more seasoning. Whilst I am no big fan of getting my menu on an IPdad, service was outstanding."

      "Well my first impression is the atmosphere which is very cozy and make feel comfortable. Although there a good view with lots of window, the Cooker Hood system seem to be quite useless. There was a table which order the steak and i can't stand the smoke. The food is affordable. It costs about 15$ a 3 courses meal. Soup and salad is served as the starter. The cream soup with mushroom I think is the best starter in the menu. The soup is very tasty. The creamy flavour blended with some salty and the chewing of the mushroom made the special of this soup. There are lots of savoury dishes such as pizza, spagetti, beefsteak, lamb, chicken and seafood but i suggest the Napoli pizza. The dough is very crispy and tons of cheese is cover the tomato and mozzarella made a great texture of the pizza.",
      "We have been to the new Hot Rock Cafe in Trung Hoa Nhan Chinh area. We like the location but we faced a bit difficulty interm of parking. Food was good but service was still no improvement found here. And the ventilation was really a headache. After dinner, we were all very oily smelled."

      "In my opinion, the menu of the restaurant is quite unique, giving me many choices. The food here is Asian grilled style, so it is very tasty. Besides, the waiters are very enthusiastic and attentive and have a certain understanding of the restaurant's dishes.",
      "I visited the restaurant with my friend last week and it's truly impressive experience. I used to visit the Tách space to drink coffee, but it was only last week that I discovered there's a restaurant inside. Food: The establishment seems to specialize in grilled dishes, which are quite suitable for casual dining and drinking. Since we went during lunchtime, my friend and I ordered a Beef Udon and a Seafood Rice. I was quite impressed with the sauce of the seafood rice I had; the flavor was rich and the sweet and sour taste was my cup of tea. The set meal was quite comprehensive, including a soup and dessert. Ambiance: The restaurant's style left a strong impression on me, with a vintage touch that truly embodies Hanoi's essence. The spacious layout ensures that clothes don't retain any lingering odors after dining. Service: The day I visited, the restaurant was fairly crowded, but the staff was quick in their service. They provided enthusiastic recommendations for suitable beverages to complement each dish. Definitely will come back for dinner and drink!!!!"

For little girls there is an abundance of princess dresses to wear. Whilst your little ones are playing parents can relax with a wide variety of drinks. I recommend the Coconut Coffee, the best we had on our visit to Hanoi. If the family gets hungry, there is a wide variety of dishes. Cleanliness is a very high priority .",

The owner himself was hands-on, his staff were all very friendly and accommodating. They did all they could to cater to our request, especially the environment-friendly decorations. They were very helpful and made sure everyone was catered to. Food was great! It is also a clean and bright place for kids to play at. I highly recommend this place for families!"

      "Yum Cha buffet lunch…in a fairly new 5 star hotel ! Impressive classy hotel foyer… restaurant has white table clothed tables.. Impressive comfy chairs..and expected classy fit out! It was a “ table buffet”..where U order a Yum Cha dish ,and it is brought to the table..next dish ordered, and the process continues. Order n eat!! Then, I turned over the menu, to discover Cantonese Roast Duck, and a couple of “ side dishes”. We were almost finished when discovering the back page .. so ordered a Roast Duck dish…!!! At first sight, it would have to be the best looking 1/4 Roast Duck, that I have seen to date.( and Cantonese Roast Duck, is my favourite dish !!! Looked absolutely “ perfect colour wise”..but lacked the flavour marinade , that is the epitome of Cantonese Roast Duck! Rate 4/10 The Yum Cha menu, is Very good, basic.(cf HK) no offal or deep fried taro , or savoury dumplings, etc, etc.. but what was available was 7.5/10. The service was a let down.. 3 staff for 5 tables ( 4..5.. and 3x2 diners) They were too occupied doing nothing, and had to virtually shout, to get their attention.. my arm was sore staying up! 3/10..a disgrace !!!",
      "Mongolian food is, shall we say, interesting. It is a little bit Chinese and a little bit Russian and a little bit mutton and potatoes oriented. But here, at Silk Road, we were served a three course lunch (salad, soup, and main) that was a lovely blend of all of the above. It was such a pleasant luncheon and delicious too. The meat wasn't fatty or tough. The soup wasn't too salty. It was quiet inside, and well decorated, and the wait staff was intent on doing their jobs. It was a lovely lunch!",
      "Dimsum was great, around 250.000vnd for a set, they have set A and B, only available for lunch! From 12-2pm everyday"

      "My fr led me to this hidden gem! Though small and a tad slow with the batch cooking, the food was out of this world. The beef noodle salad stole the show - simple, flavorful, and made with fresh ingredients. Must-try in Hanoi!",
      "We had the pleasure of dining at Xoai Du Bistro during our recent stay at the InterContinental Hanoi Westlake. Their beef noodle soup was absolutely delightful, packed with fresh vegetables and a delightful nutty crunch from the peanuts. It's the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a comforting, home-cooked meal. And for those with vegan preferences, they have a variety of plant-based options available. If you're looking for something a bit more interactive, they host chess gatherings every Sunday and even offer wine and coffee appreciation workshops.Xoai Du Bistro is truly a hidden gem worth seeking out.",
      "Everything inside is neat and clean, what makes experience even more enjoyable. Cozy and lovely place to come for a bite to eat (and a drink if you want as well!). Tucked away and quiet spot near the lake. Loads of vegetarian and vegan options of both traditional Vietnamese and other fusion style dishes. Tried my first vegan Bun Bo, huge portion for a good price and really tasty! Staff are so fast with the service, and this place is popular with both locals and tourists."

      "The first day we got there we bought something similar to kebab with bread, it was so good. The bread was crispy and tasted homemade. What was supposed to mimic kebab meat was amazing, really soft and flavorful. I, who usually have a hard time with textures, had no problems with this. Then a hamburger was taken which was served with several different toppings, everything was so good there too. Good \"meat\" and mix of vegetables. Everything felt carefully selected. The bread was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Just from this first dining experience, we have ordered from here every day since we arrived in Hanoi. Everything has been 5/5.",
      "I love this place so much! It isn't my first time here😄 Delicious food, yummy beverages- I loved everything I have tried here so far! Also great vegan condiments & vegan products are available. Lovely atmosphere and a warm & welcoming team are always here😻 A heartwarming place with great food ❤️ Thank you so much for being so awesome😍",

The menu changes every few months so you get great new options constantly. Some of the best vegan flavors you've ever had! The butcher shop variety and chocolate chip cookies are must tries. Thank you Kiez for being consistently the best!"

      "Large selection of both on tap and bottled craft beers. Cheap prices. Surprised this isn't more popular",
      "He came here around 6pm and we were the only patrons- which was surprising- all the tourists were at the the bigger joints drinking Hoeegaarden and other bottled beers. We picked this beer garden because it offered Craft beer and boy were we surprised. It was amazing! We told the bar tender what type of beer we liked and she let us taste test a few before picking our beer. It really was the best beer in Vietnam or even Best beer in the world! More people should come and enjoy local beer- not the commercial stuff!!",
      "I have tested 6 kinds of beers with the name of old streets as Hang Bac, Hang Bo, Hang Ngang, Hang Dao, Hang Bong and Nga Tu Quoc Te. Very excited place, a lot of people enjoy together in the crossroads of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen Str. That’s real funny, but when you are falling in love of Ha noi, you must to try 🍺😀🥰 Cheers!"

      "Airport restaurants come in all sizes and standards. Hai Cang at Noi Bai airport is definitely not the worst I have been to. My partner chose a Pho bo-beef noodle soup and was happy with that. I had a Ca chien kieu Anh and cannot complain. Ha Noi beer to go with it. .The staff was there but more interested in chatting to each other than caring for their guests. All in all, not the worst airport experience. Next time I will try one of the other restaurants at the airport. There must be something better!",
      "Good Vietnamese food at a reasonable price in an airport. Very clean restaurant. English not so much. No Coke -Pepsi. Would eat hear again.",
      "If you look like a Vietnamese, and started speaking English to the staff, they will start their bullying like assuming that you could not pronounce \"hot\" when you really meant \"pot\", and refuse to serve you as fast as those who did not look like Vietnamese. Not all of them were like that, some of them were nice, but those staffs who were not bullies were forced to apologize on behalf of those who were, thus an average 3 rating, otherwise, it would be 1 rating only. But why risk spoiling your mood with bullies working here, especially when you are honestly a different nationality but look like Vietnamese? To the restaurant, you might want to teach these bully staffs how to behave so that it is fair to your other nice staffs and fair to the customers as well."

      "Popped in here with a friend for dinner on a Tues evening after work, it was very quiet. It was my first visit here and I loved the decor, it was just a shame it was lacking atmosphere. It was happy hour so we enjoyed 2for1 draft beers and shared two plates of food. The chicken nachos were fairly average, if it didn't have the tiny cubes of bland chicken meat it would have actually been better! However the lamb and flatbread with dips was simply delicious. The lamb was cooked beautifully and went very well with a skewer of chargrillwd vegetables, and I would happily order that again.",

The food is truly amazing, as is the service from both the owner and the front of house waiter. We never repeat restaurant on holiday but came back a second time which was just as good.",

      "Came here for the first time for an early dinner, it was a little odd being the only people in the bar, but like like said we were eating early We both ordered the curry sausages with a side each, mine was mash which was tasty and my husband had the side of potatoes and bacon which he enjoyed too, the other side of purple cabbage that came with the dish was tasty but I think would have been better warm not cold. For me the absolute standout was their pretzels, perfect blend of salty and doughy and I would come back again and again for those! Can't comment on th bar atmosphere on a typical evening but they played skme great chilled out music while we were there",

We made friends with Linh who we spent lovely hours talking to over a couple of visits. Linh's English is amazing and puts our non-existent Vietnamese to shame! She is an outstanding member of the team. I can't recommend this place highly enough for a relaxing drink and to watch the world go by.",
      "What a great find. A bar/bistro on the edge of the Old Quarter with chill, unpretentious atmosphere, an amicable staff, and an impressive selection of whiskeys and beers. I happened on this place because it’s close to my hotel and paid a return visit because it’s got such a great vibe. Five stars.",
      "We were in Hanoi for 4 days, staying in a hotel nearby. We came in here on the first night we arrived because it was close and I am so glad we did. They make fantastic cocktails and a good selection of Vietnamese craft beer. We liked it so much we ended up coming every day we were here, later discovering that it is a great place to watch the hustle and bustle of Hanoi and to see the train passing down Train Street. The food here is also of astounding quality, the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff are extremely friendly. If you're looking for somewhere to chill out for a few hours, have a nice bite to eat, a few drinks, and watch the world go by I don't think there's a better place in Hanoi."

      "The Czech beer is quite good, as you would expect. We tried the salami appetizer, and it was pretty good. Three of us had the chicken schnitzel and I had the pork schnitzel. I would say it was decent food. The chicken was more successful than my pork, which I found too heavily breaded, a little greasy, and the breading didn't stick well to the meat. It was a nice change from all the Asian food."

      "This restaurant was suggested by our hotel, Airport Classic Hotel, which was nearby. I had the grilled shrimp with salt and chili, which was delicious. My wife had roasted chicken with ginger, which was good but my shrimp was better. I drank draft beer that was tasty and very cold. The staff was very attentive and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. We ate quite early and by the time we were finished, many locals were there. Give it a try!",
      "We came here as it was close to the airport classic hotel that we stayed in the night before returning to UK. it is a family run restaurant and very popular with the locals. It serves cheap draught beer which was very good. The staff found a couple of westerners in the restaurant quite amusing I think judging by the looks we were getting, but they also were very pleasant and did their best to look after us. The menu is also for locals with dishes that you will not see in the tourist areas of Vietnam, chickens feet, toad and bile secretion to name but a few. There were more usual dishes too, we had a chicken dish and some rice and chips which were good. I should add that the prices were extremely cheap",
      "We were expecting a restaurant with pizza and fruit smoothies per another review, so perhaps that review belongs elsewhere since they serve neither. Extensive menu, almost too many choices. Once we were there we couldn’t leave with so few other choices around the airport. There were lots of locals by the time we left and it seemed like a popular place for draft beer. We enjoyed the grilled shrimp with chili although not much flavor on its own. Nice to have an English menu and Google translate helped. Friendly staff but not one of our better meals in the past three weeks in Vietnam."

Hot day like this you will want to stop for a bowl of che or if you like, you can mix everything in a cup with ice. The main ingredients are mung beans, grated coconut, and kidney beans. Stop by and sit on the stool like the locals or have it on the go.",

      "I have visited this place more than 3 times during a week as it offers best Hanoi grilled fish. Unlike other restaurants serving similar dishes, it also serves fish congee and fried fish rolls. These dishes must be tried at all cost. The price is reasonable. Service is fine. However it is often packed with guests at noon time. Make sure you phone to the restaurant to for booking first and try to be on time. The old owner seems to be grumpy to late comers :-)",
      "Hanoi is famous with many special food, one of that is ‘Cha Ca’. In Hanoi, there are several restaurants famous for Cha Ca such as La Vong, Thang Long, Lao Ngu, Gia Ngu. I had tried 3 of 4 restaurants above and Lao Ngu is one of my most fav restaurant. The grilled fish is very fresh, the shrimp paste is delicious & suit your taste 😍 Also after the meal, u will be served tofu & hot green tea to remove the smell of shrimp paste, only at Lao Ngu u’ll experience this :)"

Got to table waited about 5 minutes for a menu. Finally ordered dumplings and sweet corn soup. Dumplings were nothing special and soup was too sweet. The bill for 9 Dumplings and soup was over 200 VND. Atmosphere was cold, staff couldn't have cared less if we were there or not. Had to get there attention for the bill. There was only 1 other group. Go elsewhere for a better meal and experience.",

There is a delicious puffer fish dish here, but you have to order it in advance. If you come and not order in advance, it won't be enough. I recommend Ozaki beef. The staff introduced it as a premium beef. The meat is tender and juicy and delicious. Attentive service, extremely thoughtful hostess. In general, this is my favorite restaurant and I always recommend it to friends and partners.",

      "After the commantaire's so kind people leave the reviews on the 1915y restaurant, I want to eat well so I went to dinner, it was really delicious !!! a green mango salad, cold rolls, a tender green pepper beef on a hot plate and to finish a superb fish dish prepared in 4dischs and green leaves had an amazing taste of oyster flavors. a carrot juice and two beers. all this costs 1155000 dong, = 45 € for 3 people, with friends, we can not take desserts, eat too much. To recommend this restaurant and a young master hotel Mr van is too kind as the other hostesses are so helpful. all give off the charms of Hanoi ...",
      "On my daughter's birthday. My family came this restaurant to have a small party here. The foods were delicious with traditional lavour. The staffs were very polite and religious. I think this place suit for meeting friends, couples and family. The price suit for everyone."

      "Best place to get ramen and Japanese curry with a very reasonable price as well! I've visited many ramen places across Hanoi and this restaurant cannot be beat.You can tell the head chef/owner is passionate and cares about each dish. My favorite is the miso ramen which had a rich flavor while not being too salty like others I've tried. The noodles are very filling and delicious! I've recommended this to many people I know and taken my friends on multiple occasions. Must try!!",

The mushrooms in donuts were excellent. For dessert we asked for fresh fruit that was not on the menu. We had 3 different kinds of fruit. Very good experience in a vegetarian restaurant for carnivores.",
      "I found this restaurant by coincidence and it was the last and also by far the best meal during my four weeks in Vietnam. I went to the lunch buffet that takes place 3 times a week and the all vegan food was amazing. The best Pho in my life, phantastic choise of vegetables, mock fish and meat, even desert. 95.000 Duong including green tea! Everything had a different and unique taste. I took another portion away for a friend and they were extremely generous by giving me all kind of food containers. I just wish I had discovered this restaurant on my first day in Hà Noi.",

The cuisine is delightful, healthy, and cooked with minimal oil, making it both satisfying and easy to digest.

I have eaten hundreds of bowls of Pho Bo around Hanoi over the past 15 years and many bowls at Pho Vui, the happy pho place. They have the best. It is without question my favourite. I go back, and back and back again. Consistent every time and beautiful 😍",

When I got the bill and asked about the spring rolls after lots of laughing I had eaten 2 steamed pig knobs, wangers doodles, p3n1s.

      "This is one of my favourite restaurants in hanoi. I've been in tunglok Singapore twice so this place is really brought me the \"wow\" feeling like I was in Singapore The decor concept is remained, the food have the same taste and staffs here are really nice & helpful I just wonder why the restaurants is not so crowded as it should be. I think they should promote it more one social",
      "i was here with my family 2 weeks ago by the recomendation of my friend. i had heard many \"wow\" before really in here tasting this awesome dimsum and indeed it did not let me down even a bit. The dimsum is served in the traditional way with a a steamer, thin crust, spicy sauce and alot of meet inside. we also order some other dishes but dimsum's still impressed me most the total payment is quite high for the daily meal but worth for an outside family lunch/dinner"

And the food was tasty - but the portions were really small for the high prices. The restaurant is located on a small, charming little alley. The bar is extensive but we didn't have alcohol. The pesto was delicious - but again, USD 2 for four tiny slices of ham was ridiculous.",
      "Loved the extensive wine lists and their black squid ink risotto. Had a nice Prosecco to pair with and the bill was less than 60 for three people",
      "My company had year end party in Cousins Tran Quoc Toan last Dec. Didnt know there’s a place like this in such a small valley Doan nhu hai. The resto was very warm and cozy, a fireplace during cold Hanoi weather inside a 100 years-old villa made our diner really impressive, not to mention we had great tarta beef and perfect trout with pasta. Since then, Cousins was one of my favorite place"

      "We stumbled upon Club Opera while window shopping in the streets of the French Quarter. For hungry, clueless pedestrians, what a lucky find! Although we'd had several great food and dining experiences during our time in Vietnam, our dinner at this sweet little restaurant in Hanoi turned out to be the very best of all of them. In both flavor and presentation, our seafood dinners were excellent. We also very much enjoyed the ambience of the room which, similar to our hotel at the nearby Sofitel Legend Metropole, offers a historically elegant fusion of French and Vietnamese cultures. Like others, we agree that our meal was expensive by Vietnamese standards. Nevertheless, as New Yorkers enjoying a humongously generous USD-VND exchange rate, we cannot not fairly complain that our tab was inappropriate for such fine dining. We highly recommend Club Opera!"

      "My daughter and I chanced upon this restaurant and thought it would be worth trying, given its clean and professional appearance, as well as its reasonable prices and moderate clientele. Upon entering, we were greeted warmly by the staff, who took the time to explain the menu and offer recommendations. We decided on the all-you-can-eat seafood option, which included complimentary water, although we did order additional drinks. We began by ordering a tower, and the waiter kindly offered to peel the prawns and crab for us. As we waited, we ordered another tower for four, and the food continued to arrive as we placed our orders. The cuisine was expertly prepared, aromatic, and flavorful. Dessert was also included in the meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant and was impressed by their desire for feedback on the service and food.",

      "We ordered a pour over using Finca Soledad Syndra roast, a single source bean from Peru. The pour over was clean, light, high acidity with floral tones. It paired well with the custard croissant we ordered. The cafe feels clinical, very clean, bright and basically furnished. The barista who made our pour over was knowledgeable about the bean and its origins, and informative about their brand and how they source their beans which are roasted onsite. We would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good brew and reasonably priced beverages and pastries. We enjoyed ourselves while we were there.",

Staff can tell you all the stories about the beans.",
      "Introduced by my friend as we are heavy coffee drinkers with espresso machine at home. The coffee is special with high score beans sourced directly from farm. The staffs are also very knowledgeable and give us very details about each type of beans, what method to use, which pastry is compatible with the coffee choice. Although the price may not be suitable for normal daily coffee dosage, we think it’s worth it"

      "We decided to have dinner at Le Petit Bistro based on reviews and after looking at the menu. The restaurant and experience were amongst the best we've had in Vietnam. The authentically French food, ambience and staff were outstanding. We enjoyed talking to Peter who co-owns the restaurant with his wife. The chef also came and talked to us after we'd finished our meal. It was nice of them to take time to talk to us and we had nothing but positive feedback from them. As noted in other reviews, there are many high end French restaurants in Danang that charge near US prices. Peter noted that the restaurant is only a little over a month old and they want to build a customer base so are committed to providing the highest quality food, generous portions, at competitive prices. The meal we had last night would have cost three to four times what we would have paid in the US and we had superior service. Try this restaurant before everyone else figures it out!",
      "A welcome contrast to Asian cuisine in a city with such a vast choice of seafood. This was without doubt the most enjoyable dining experience during our month long stay in DaNang. The French onion soup with garlic baguette was a generous bowl, but light and delicately sweet with a sprinkle of cheese. The ribeye was tender and cooked to perfection, medium rare, with beautifully seasoned fries and a creamy dauphinoise side. My partner had the Duck a l’orange which was cooked sous-vide style at low temp and it was tender and succulent. The desserts were also quintessentially French with Crème Brûlée and a Chocolate Soufflé to finish. We enjoyed meeting the English chef who clearly enjoys his profession and sourcing the very best ingredients for their menu. If you are looking for unpretentious sophistication with very reasonably priced menu then Le Petit Bistro is a great choice.",
      "An alley located cozy restaurant with impressive service and crusine. Highly recommend the Duck A L’Orange served with Dauphinoise Potato 😋 Partner loves the Steak Frites Chargrilled House Cut of Steak with Rosemary Salted Fries, Garlic Parsley Butter. Thank you for arranging the window seat, we had a great night and looking for tasting menu next time we visit"

Everything we tried was absolutely delicious – from the aromatic pho to the perfectly seasoned banh xeo. The best part? The prices are incredibly affordable, making it easy to indulge without breaking the bank.

Completely understandable that this restaurant has a Michellin star! If I come back to Da Nang in the future, I’ll definitely make it a point to return here 🥰",

You should reserve a table as it gets busy from 6pm so if you don’t book expect to queue! First time we had beef noodles for my 9 year old he ate the lot with steak n chips! We had the beef rolls and they show you how to make it so don’t be afraid to try it, the chicken clay pot is amazing chicken very tender, morning glory with garlic and beef with peppers. The lemon grass juice is delicious, you can’t buy wine by the glass but they have a few cocktails and beers. They only thing is that they don’t do starters and main everything comes at once so the table can get very crowded and dishes can go cold while your trying to finish the wraps etc so I’d order as you go, staff are lovely the place is busy so second time we got there for 5.30 and was ok to sit inside in the aircon area.",

      "This is a restaurant that serves delicious banh xeo. I chose the pork version. The staff taught me how to eat it. You put the banh xeo on rice paper, top with lettuce and herbs, and dip it in the sauce. It's said that it's better to blend the two types of sauce available. The portions are large, so if you're alone, this one dish is enough to fill you up. The non-alcoholic mojito was also incredibly delicious. It's clean, reasonably priced, and the food is reasonably high quality, so I think it's a convenient restaurant to visit. You can also take away any leftovers.",
      "It was a great experience. I think I’ve never had such a tasting in vietnamese cuisine like i did in such a place. It’s common sense that when you see a crowd struggling for a seat in a restaurant it means that it’s a great one. Well it was a great one, yea, not because of the crowd, but rather the food was really excellent. It’s a place to go back to, whenever i visit Da Nang! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"

      "I found this place while looking for a restaurant that suits the local atmosphere rather than Korean tourists. I was able to eat Tomahawk for half the price in Korea, the owner was friendly, and I was able to get a T membership discount, which was nice. Satisfies.",
      "Was the perfect location to see the dragon bridge light up. The staff were so attentive and the food excellent. The waiter was very friendly and attentive making sure we were completely happy with everything. One of the best meals we have had in na nang",
      "This is a great restaurant for a steak dinner. Lots of family-friendly options too like pasta and hamburgers. We came on a Friday night and booked for 7.30pm. The timing was perfect as we were ready for coffee and desert by the 9pm Dragon Bridge show. Top tip: get your reservation in early and request a table upstairs on the veranda. When we booked the veranda was fully booked, but a group left around 8.30pm and the restaurant staff very kindly let us move tables onto the veranda for our desert. It was a great spot for the kids to see the Dragon Bridge show."

      "This is undeniably one of the best French restaurants we have ever been to in the world! We arrived in Da Nang yesterday and the restaurant at our hotel was closed, so we went out to find place to eat. And it was just there on the street in front of us after we walked for only a few minutes. We didn’t have a reservation, and they normally cannot accommodate walk-ins, but it was our lucky day because they found us a table. (Please don’t just show up because you really must make reservation.) Everything was amazing, Including the butter for the bread (they have 4 kinds to choose from!) The sommelier (wine professional) helped us choose the perfect pairing for our meal. They have two set menus, but because I am gluten intolerant, we chose appetizers and entrées from their a-la-carte menu. Not everything I chose was gluten-free, but they were able to make changes so that I could eat everything! Thank you so much to the chef and the sommelier and the wonderful servers who took such good care of us. We love this restaurant, and we will definitely be eating here again.",
      "A friend recommended me to celebrate my birthday in this restaurant. The price is reasonable and the taste is ok, especially the black snowfish, which is very delicious. The staff has good service attitude and the restaurant atmosphere makes you comfortable. They also gave me a free dessert and took a photo for me. I was very happy when the photo was taken. Thank you to the owner for the arrangement💕It is best to make a reservation, otherwise you may have to wait a long time to be seated.",
      "I went to dinner in Da Nang with my wife. It's a bit of a distance from the city, so I took a GrabCar. The shop is in a quiet residential area. The appearance of the shop is also very nice. I was a little nervous because it was a famous restaurant, but they welcomed me with a friendly smile, and I was relieved that the atmosphere inside the restaurant was relaxing. Also, the work of the staff is crisp and comfortable. I asked for a five-course course of Wagyu beef and ordered black tea because I couldn't drink. Cooking has given my brain a very good pleasure in complex flavors that I have never tasted from a single item. All five dishes were wonderfully delicious and I had a satisfying time. The black tea was so good that I ordered the same again and he gave me a little secret recipe. I can't believe it's in there! I was so happy until the last dessert (the smell of bushkan) that I was really glad to include this restaurant on this trip. It was a very good memory. Thank you for the best food and service."

      "I was genuinely surprised by how packed Mộc Seafood Restaurant was! Even at 9pm, there was still a line of people waiting, so I’d definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if you don’t want to wait. The atmosphere has a charming Vietnamese style, warm and welcoming. However, because it was so crowded, it was a bit noisy and made conversations a little difficult. Now, let’s talk about the food — absolutely worth the hype. The seafood is incredibly fresh, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality. The menu offers a wide variety of options, including live seafood. I highly recommend trying the lobster and grouper sashimi — both were sweet, tender, and full of flavor. Every dish we tried was well-seasoned and delicious. Overall, despite the crowd, it’s a fantastic spot for seafood lovers. Just plan ahead and come hungry!",
      "Delicious fresh seafood dinner. We did not have a reservation and waited for about 20 minutes to get a table. We were not seated outside but in the multi-story building ext door. The waitress escorted us to our table. Incredibly fresh. We all had lobster and prawns. They took us out to choose the lobsters and weighed them for us so we knew how much we were paying up front. The tamarind prawns were amazing (minimum order was 300gms). We ordered 500gms between 2 people. We also had a 750gm lobster with garlic butter sauce- very rich. Prices are amazing with it working out around $50Aud / head including drinks and bread for mopping up the sauce. There are also several non-seafood meals for those who do not eat seafood. They also peel your prawns as well!",
      "Exactly what we hoped and wished for. You had seen the reviews, photos and a few YouTubes about the restaurant and made it our first meal when we landed in DaNang. We had some trouble with reservations, but contacted them via FB messenger and it was promptly and efficiently sorted. Arrived to a lovely greeting and given time to look over the menu but it wasn’t really needed as we knew exactly what we wanted and was promptly taken to the tanks to select our dinner. Service was amazing, friendly and it was a real treat to have our freshly cooked seafood peeled and prepared for our very ravenous tummies after a long 24 hour traveling. We thought the garlic butter would be our favorite but to our surprise the salted egg was outstanding. (Garlic butter still very yummy) We over ordered but the price compared to home costs was still totally worth it. We are now totally spoiled as we will always compare this delicious food and brilliant service and we have all agreed, there won’t be anywhere else that can do it better."

      "When I stepped into Rang Indian Restaurant in Da Nang, I felt as if I had fallen into a miniature India in the heart of this beautiful city. Every little corner of the space looked like a vibrant painting, promising to create stunning photos that make you want to capture those wonderful moments forever. As I immersed myself in that colorful atmosphere, I could not help but be amazed by the culinary journey that awaited. The menu here is incredibly diverse and rich, with each dish not only delicious but also presented with such finesse, like works of art on a plate. Although I am not a die-hard fan of Indian cuisine, I was enchanted by the essence and allure of the dishes here. The concept is not only colorful but also holds a touch of mystery, which made me love this space even more. The staff at Rang is also very charming and enthusiastic, contributing to making my experience even more complete. If someone asked me about Indian cuisine in Vietnam, I would not hesitate to recommend they visit Rang and try any dish from the menu. I am sure everyone will be drawn to the unique flavors, and what’s more, the prices here are extremely reasonable, making me feel truly fortunate to enjoy high-quality dishes with excellent service without worrying about costs. Rang is not just an ordinary Indian restaurant; it is truly a place that harmonizes the art, culture, and exquisite cuisine of India!",
      "We have visited end of January 2025 and had a fantastic experience. The atmosphere very chill, modern and welcoming. The stuff was extremely friendly and top notch service. I took malai kofta - the best one I’ve ever tried. I highly recommend everyone, though the price may look a bit above the average but the quality of food and service worth it. I’m definitely coming there again."

You can see and choose seafood at the entrance, and the staff is quick to respond and cheerful. Crayfish cooked with butter and cheese and king crab are the signatures. The price is reasonable. It was a great experience. It is good for a meal with clean ingredients and a clean atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

      "We had afternoon tea and breakfast. Afternoon tea time was such a strong wind that napkins flew on the table, and the tea cooled quickly. The sweets were all delicious, especially canelé and scones. Breakfast was not the first thing in the morning, but when I told them what I wanted to eat outside, they took turns to show me around. There was so much alcohol, I was dazzled. In particular, the bread was plentiful and everything looked delicious. Some of them were made on the spot, such as pho and egg dishes. erika, who was in charge of the table at breakfast, was very kind and took nice pictures from various angles. The views are so great that I think it's worth stopping by or just sitting back and getting a taste of the atmosphere. Please note that some photos are quite dark depending on the time and place, so you may not be able to take them beautifully with your phone."

      "Nice restaurant atmosphere and service is OK nothing more nothing less. Needs to be taken off the Michelin guide definitely. Food seemed fairly priced until the portion sizes came out then I felt that I was ripped off completely. Beer and coke served in cans and were warm (asked for cold and they didn’t have any) Extremely average you’d be better off just having street food.",
      "We tried out this restaurant followed the review on Tiktok from a food blogger. The food is good, some dishes portion are not worth the price, for example the grilled chicken. We ordered 1/2 grilled chicken but the portion looks like there’s only 1/4 of a chicken. The Madame Lan grilled fish is truly a must try one, plus the stirring squid with pineapple. The Luk Lake beef we requested medium well but it too hard for chewing like well-done instead. The restaurant is an open space, no AC so it will be hot for lunch, but ok for dinner with fresh air. Design with lantern decorations bring Hoi An atmosphere. The location is just right behind the fireworks station. Price is a bit high for a local restaurant, it is more touristic nowadays as many travelers visit, not much local residents. Staff is not attentive at all, especially the girl that serve our table. She delivered the drinks but pour it all over the table and my friend’s clothes, no apology nor clean it after that. Very bad attitude, they are more focus on foreigners than Vietnamese. My tour guide booked the table under my name but the hottest apparently said there’s no table reserved under my name, it took 10mins to find out my reservation but then the table had someone else used it. Overall experience is not really pleasant except some of the food",
      "Nhà hàng Madame Lân: A Feast for the Eyes, But Not the Palate Located beside the charming river in Danang, Nhà hàng Madame Lân welcomes guests with its elegant décor and picturesque setting. While it offers a delightful feast for the eyes, it leaves something to be desired when it comes to the culinary experience. Pros: Beautiful Decor: Nhà hàng Madame Lân is dressed to impress. The décor is beautifully put together and offers endless opportunities for those picture-perfect moments. From the intricate design details to the well-thought-out placement of decorative items, the visual aesthetics are indeed commendable. Great Selection of Food: One of the highlights of Nhà hàng Madame Lân is its extensive food selection. Catering to different tastes and preferences, the menu provides a wide variety of options that promises to tempt every palate. Great Location: Situated next to the river, the restaurant enjoys an enviable location that not only adds to its charm but also makes it easily accessible. The view of the river complements the dining experience, enhancing the restaurant's overall appeal. Cons: Mediocre Food: Despite its great variety and impressive appearance, the food at Nhà hàng Madame Lân falls short in taste. Described as extremely average and lacking any distinct or memorable flavors, the culinary experience does not live up to the expectations set by the venue's lovely ambiance and décor. Pricey by Local Standards: Considering the mediocrity of the food, the price range at Nhà hàng Madame Lân might seem a bit steep, especially when compared to local standards. The disconnect between price and taste quality might leave some patrons feeling underwhelmed. Conclusion: Nhà hàng Madame Lân is a beautiful dining spot in Danang, perfect for those who appreciate visual beauty and a fantastic location. However, if your primary focus is on a satisfying culinary experience, you might find it lacking. The restaurant's broad selection of dishes and wonderful ambiance make it a place worth visiting, but set your expectations appropriately regarding the food's taste and price. Ideal for special occasions or for those looking to enjoy a picturesque dining environment, Nhà hàng Madame Lân serves as a reminder that beauty doesn't always translate to flavor."

      "A restaurant well deserving of its Michelin star. Beautiful surroundings, excellent friendly service, fabulous food. After reading a number of reviews on Trip Advisor giving La Maison’s food low ratings, I was anxious to make my own decision. The conclusion is that those reviewers could have been eating in different restaurant or the food has improved exponentially since they were there. The meal that my wife and I enjoyed was as good as any Michelin one star restaurant that we have been to. Some dishes, such as the GRATINÉE D'OIGNONS, were what one might typically enjoy in a 3 star restaurant. I had asked for a pescatarian menu degustation, which resulted in only one change from lamb to spaghetti. I then imagined a bowl of spaghetti bolognaise or similar, but received an imaginative and very tasty creation in which I only found the spaghetti forming a wall of 2 cm pieces when I dug into it. I suspect that the vegetarian menu would be well worth trying. The 8 course menu was expensive but very good value for money. The dishes involving truffle had a very generous quantity of Perigord truffle shaved over them. There were two choices or wine menu paired with dishes. One involved 8 wines, including older vintages, and cost the equivalent of about USD298 per head, while the other, which we had, consisted of 5 generally younger wines costing the equivalent of about USD156 per person. The five wines were well matched and a couple were quite special but, considering they amounted to about 2/3rds of a bottle in total, if I went again I’d probably choose a couple of older wines from the wine list for a similar or larger cost. The beautiful surroundings and the cable car ride to the restaurant add to a memorable evening. I’d recommend La Maison 1888 to any food lover visiting Danang.",
      "We had an enjoyable dinner at this famed French restaurant in Da Nang. The ambience of the restaurant is very homely and feels like you are in a small upscale bistro in Europe. We had the Spring tasting menu designed and curated by Pierre Gagnaire. In keeping with Pierre’s signature style, both the source of ingredients and gestronomic techniques had the nice balance of classic French cooking with a detectable octave of Asian note. The staff was very professional rendering the right level of attentive service respecting the customers’ enjoyment of each course leisurely. The wine pairing selection made by the sommelier was a perfect match to each course and complimented the special flavour meant to be enjoyed. Gastronomy is an artistry. Like any art form, personal preference, taste and experience all play a factor in its appreciation and enjoyment. We were glad that we picked La Maison 1888 during our visit to Da Nang despite some not so positive comments and reviews. We would not be surprised that La Maison will get its own star if Michelin has decided to include Da Nang in its guide in the near future.",
      "Had dinner in this highly acclaimed French restaurant in Danang. The setting was beautiful as the restaurant was housed in a French-styled mansion on the slope of the very exclusive Intercontinental Danang hotel. The restaurant interior deco was nice and the service attentive but not intrusive. The ambiance was excellent and romantic. However, the food served, although nice, fell short of expectations of a restaurant of such reputation and pricing. If you have to pay about VND6 million (USD244) per head in Vietnam for a dinner, you'd better expect something very extraordinary. There wasn't any wow factor. For less than 5% of the pricing, you could actually eat an excellent Vietnamese meal in a local restaurant in Danang city!"

      "It's so delicious. Especially the Jjamppong pasta. The price is similar to Korean Jjamppong, but when you look at the ingredients, it makes sense. And the staff is very friendly, the restaurant has a classy atmosphere, and the entrance has a Korean Instagram feel. There is a separate lunch menu, so I recommend trying it.",
      "The modern and stylish restaurant in Vietnam's Danang, the spacious seats and coolness were impressive, the Vietnamese food was similar in every restaurant, and it was too good to taste. Vietnamese meats were very popular, and the pink-solt restaurant is soft, rich in juicy steaks and delicious, so it's easy for the family to eat at a price, and lovers think it's perfect for tasty food and atmosphere. Steak Recommendation, cream paste tomato paste, salad. Especially the Seafood Cream Pasta. I put the steak in the set menu, and the family had enough and good meat, especially the liver, and the ganish was very good! Recommendation for flavoring in Batman!",
      "The quality of the food is really good, and the staff are very friendly. They changed us to a good spot and took care of each and every detail, and their sensible response stood out. You may think the prices are expensive compared to local restaurants, but the individual items were not that expensive and the portions were larger than expected, so the prices felt more reasonable. The pink salt pasta was delicious, and the seasoned octopus was also good, but I think I'll try the puffo next time. The lamb ribs were good because they didn't smell and were just right👍 If you want to have a delicious dinner in Da Nang with a nice atmosphere, I recommend this place~! I think it would be better if you asked for a sofa seat assignment when making a reservation^^ (We didn't use it, but a seat opened up in the middle, so we changed it💝)"

The restaurant offers top-notch food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere that makes it perfect for special occasions or a casual treat-yourself meal.

On top of that, Missteak has a delightful surprise for popcorn fans—their spiced popcorn is simply amazing and worth a try. Though on the pricier side, the overall experience at Missteak justifies the cost, delivering one of the finest steakhouse experiences in Da Nang.",
      "The staff are very friendly. In particular, the male manager's smile is very bright and pleasant. It's formal yet casual and friendly, so it feels like you're eating in a nice place. The quality of the meat is good and it's nice that you can order various sauces. The meat is served warm on a stone plate, and the pepper and salt popcorn is addictive.",
      "Wow! We almost didn’t come because of the limited menu but I’m so glad we did! My husband had the ribeye and I had the flat iron steak which was upgraded to a wagyu steak to celebrate the lunar new year. Both steaks were cooked perfectly! I also recommend the corn ribs and penicillin cocktail. We finished off with the carmel cheesecake which was great without being too sweet. We went to a couple other steak places in Da Nang and this was by far the best one. It’s a fairly new restaurant so not a ton of reviews but this was our favorite place in Da Nang!"

It came with a separate shot of espresso that you can pour onto the coconut drink. It was very tasty. Before I left I had wanted to try another coffee so I bought the Saigon milk coffee.

      "We came to Olivia's Prime Steakhouse to celebrate our girl's birthday after search many Da Nang fine dining restaurants. We ordered salad, chicken bbq, ribeye steaks. Salad was fresh, chicken bbq was delicious and steaks were fresh, wonderful and cooked as our request. I have never had such delicious steaks before. They use wood grill instead of gas grill like other restaurants, that is why the steaks are so special. Staffs were very attentive to take care of our group. They offered a free cake for birthday and also chocolate vodka for everyone at the end. Although it was pricey but we both agreed that it was worth: luxury restaurant, 5 star service, perfectly cooked steaks - can not expect more. Many thanks for hosting our group. Sure to go back. Highly recommended.",
      "Wow, what a culinary delight! Olivia's Steakhouse in Da Nang exceeded our expectations in every way. The steaks were cooked to perfection - tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The lamb cutlets were equally impressive, with a beautiful char on the outside and a deliciously pink interior. But what really made our experience stand out was the exceptional service. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, making great recommendations and ensuring our glasses were always full. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet cozy, making it perfect for a special occasion or a night out with friends. We can't wait to come back and indulge in Olivia's incredible steaks again. 5 stars isn't enough - we'd give it 10 stars if we could!",
      "Was craving a steak and found this place through google, food and drinks were great and service was also excellent. Steaks are very expensive but all the beef is imported from Australia, USA and Japan so it’s expected other non steak meals are reasonably priced. Would happily go back 👍"

      "Very swanky restaurant on the river side of Da Nang. Probably one of the quickest dinner services I’ve ever experienced for a higher end establishment, with no complaints. Thought it was odd that they were playing Christmas music, being that it’s early April… friendly and attentive staff. The wagyu was my favorite dish of the evening, along with the yuzu cake. It wasn’t too sweet and the perfect tartness. Thought the pizza was a miss… the cheese was a bit too thick and hardened fairly quick.",
      "Everything here is wonderful. Extremely friendly staff from the waiter, manager to the chef. Delicious food, clean restaurant, top view, quiet and luxurious space. And the prices are very reasonable for everything here and in my opinion it's quite cheap. Well, if you come here, if you want to live virtual, you don't have to worry about anyone taking pictures. The staff proactively helped me and was very happy and enthusiastic. I didn't expect it. The day I went, Chau served me. The advice on dishes and types of service was very attentive, my birthday was even more perfect. In general, I can only thank you very much and wish the restaurant to always develop ❤️"

      "I ordered margherita pizza, T-bone steak, and carbonara, and I recommend the steak the most! I ordered it medium and it was well cooked and good. The sauce that came with the steak was also delicious. I came around 11:30 a.m. on a weekday, there were hardly any people and the food came out quickly.",
      "We had dinner two nights, the food was delicious. We have ordered pizzas, two varieties one day and two varieties another day and they were all delicious. The two waitresses who served us on the two different days were both wonderful. We sat at the top and at night you could see the entire river with views of the ships. It was a super nice experience One of the girls was trying to speak in Spanish which we found very nice. Thank you very much, highly recommended place in terms of quality, price and location.",
      "While in Da Nang, Vietnam on vacation my friend, and I decided stop in at the Cardi Pizzeria on Bach Dang, which we learned is one of 4 Cardi Pizzerias located there. We’re so glad we did, because we ended up having a delightful encounter with their wonderful waitress, Anna. She began by greeting us with a big smile, and a lot of enthusiasm. To our great relief, since we speak no Vietnamese, she spoke excellent English, so we asked her how she had learned to speak it so well. She told us she had learned it on her own, mostly by watching American movies, which was quite a surprise. When taking our orders, she repeated them back to us, word for word, to verify them, which demonstrated her professional attention to detail. Unlike most other places we’ve eaten at, throughout Southeast Asia, she delivered our food, and drinks together, which was another nice, and very welcome touch that we were grateful for. We each had a small pizza, which is just about the perfect size for one person. I had a coconut smoothie that was absolutely fantastic, but I can’t remember what my friend had to drink. Anna was attentive, outgoing, personable, friendly, and quite frankly, very refreshing. We ended up having a somewhat lengthy conversation, interspersed with lots of laughter. Anna’s an excellent waitress, and it’s obvious that she enjoys her job, because her happy-go-lucky attitude shines through. By the time we finished eating, and left, we felt we’d had a good meal, and found a new friend. If you’re ever in Da Nang, and stop in at the Cardi Pizzeria on Bach Dang, and you’re lucky enough to have Anna as your waitress, you’ll be able to make some marvelous memories, while having a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Our only regret is that we had such a fun time, that we forgot to get a selfie with Anna to memorialize our time there. I think it’ll be okay, though, because we’ll make sure to remember to do it the next time we stop in."

The watermelon served later was also very refreshing, adding a pleasant ending to the meal.",

The texture of the pancakes here reminded me of my mama’s pancakes from when I was little, which left me feeling very nostalgic. Every dish I tried was delicious. The restaurant was very clean. The service was fast. The staff was very friendly and helpful; my non-Vietnamese speaking friend was explained about each dish he inquired. The hostess spoke perfect English.

We started with Fois Gras, followwing some delicious canapes. The Fois Gras was perfectly cooked which can be an issue in VN. We followed with a Steak and Stuffed Squid. Both delicious. A must do if you are in Da Nang!",
      "Amazing food, wonderful service. Started with some freshly shucked French oysters and foi grois. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked - so much flavour and beautifully tender. Paired with amazing handcut chips and a jus that was a major highlight. Lobster bisque sauce with scampi and cote de boef an interesting and wonderful combination. Some calvados before dessert helped clear our stomachs for the French cheesecake, an old family recipe (paired with a beautifully balanced sorbet). Could not recommend this restaurant enough , very authentic and extremely well priced for the quality of food. Every dish was very well thought out and considered, and the service was welcoming and knowledgeable. Also a very good wine list with many great French reds that do not break the bank."

Beaten by unusually strong wind and busy rush hour streets, we found a sanctuary of peace, serenity, warm smiles, wonderful hospitality and delicious food. Very nice minimal decoration- which is super pleasant for the eye after all the colourful lanterns and illumination around- pleasant instrumental music, very generous portions charged with taste and flavours. I would absolutely recommend it for any traveller! A small touch - they even have bamboo baskets for lady purse:-)"

      "I went there because it seemed easy to enter near the hotel. The menu says this is a bestseller, so I asked for the bestseller pho on the very first page. Seasoning was my favorite. The passion fruit juice was delicious. The service is good. The cold tea was also delicious. I went there at about 5:30 and it was empty, but around 6:00 the crowd kept coming in and it was full.",
      "We loved this place and went back twice. The Pho, Mi Quang and Prawn spring rolls were stand outs. Service is excellent, prices are terrific and the place really shows off a variety of Vietnamese dishes. I put the stand outs in but we really loved all the dishes, including Sweet and Sour Pork, Braised Pork, Spring Rolls and Chicken Wings. We would go back again if we were not leaving. Go early to avoid the queue for a table. A stand out of our 2 weeks trip."

      "The service was excellent, they were very attentive and even offered to shell the prawns for us. Like me, the staff was incredibly polite, spoke excellent English, and made excellent recommendations. In addition, the location was spotless. The lobsters at TinTin Seafood Restaurant are huge, live, and caught right from the tank. They are so fresh and delicious, and they are very reasonably priced and the overall atmosphere is very beautiful. I highly recommend TinTin Seafood Restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy a delicious and memorable meal.",
      "TinTin Seafood Restaurant is hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever been to. I ordered a 1.2 kg grilled lobster that cost a little over $50. The food was prepared with care, and the grilled lobster was cooked perfectly. The meat was firm, delicious, and fresh. The staff even helped me peel the lobster, which I really appreciated. I was very satisfied with the service here. Everything was excellent, from the atmosphere to the staff.",
      "The best seafood restaurant in Da Nang After receiving a recommendation from an acquaintance, I made a reservation directly through Google Maps. It's very convenient with free pick-up service to the hotel. As soon as you get out of the car, employees will wait in front of the door and guide you with a large parasol. The menu is written in various languages, making it easy to understand and order without a translator. The seafood in each dish was very fresh, and when I personally selected the lobster from the aquarium, they not only cooked it deliciously, but also prepared it so it was easy to eat, so I was satisfied with both the taste and the service. The store has a spacious and cozy atmosphere, and the private VIP room is equipped with karaoke facilities, so it was even better to enjoy drinking and singing together. There is a massage shop on the second floor, and the staff skillfully massages the desired area and intensity according to your needs, so your fatigue is completely relieved. This place has the advantage of offering a full course including meals, drinks, and massage. All of the people I went with had a delicious meal and were satisfied, so I plan to visit again when I travel again. If you travel to Da Nang, I highly recommend you go there. I think it will soon be selected as a Michelin 5-star restaurant."

      "I had an amazing experience at this Korean BBQ restaurant! The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure we felt comfortable the entire time. The food was absolutely delicious — the meat was fresh and perfectly seasoned, and the variety of dishes really impressed me. The ambiance was also great with a beautiful view, which made the meal even more enjoyable. As it was March 8th, they also gave flowers to all the women, which was such a lovely gesture! Overall, everything was perfect, and I would rate it 10/10. Highly recommend!",
      "This is the most premium samgyup barbecue place I’ve ever been to. The staff are very, very accommodating. Each table gets a dedicated server who cooks the meat for you, so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. It really makes you feel pampered while you eat, like you’re getting dinner and a show at the same time! Everything was so yummy, and the quality of the food really stood out. As expected, it’s expensive, but you definitely feel like you’re paying for a premium experience. I really enjoyed it!",
      "We had a fantastic dining experience at Golden Meat House! From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive — always ready to assist with grilling, give recommendations, and ensure we were comfortable throughout our meal. Their service was top-notch and made us feel well taken care of. The food was equally impressive. Every cut of meat was fresh, well-marinated, and full of flavor — especially the pork belly and beef short ribs. The side dishes were generous and delicious, and the overall quality of the ingredients really stood out. Golden Meat House is a must-visit for Korean BBQ lovers. Great service, excellent food, and a warm atmosphere — we’ll definitely be back!"

The food was delicious from start to finish, staff were absolutely brilliant and the owner was so kind to come round with the biggest smile on his face checking how our food was. He told us all about his restaurant and even offered us a table on the top rooftop floor so we could get a superb view of the dragon bridge. The team were absolutely fantastic! My partner and I couldn’t recommend this place any more! Thank you team!",
      "A home run. Owner Carmen is charming. Food was excellent. Bonus: view of dragon bridge from roof top dining area. We ordered: bruschetta, pumpkin soup, pasta carbonara, pasta bolognese, and the tiramisu. All authentic and delicious. The menu doesn’t say what the house red wine is but Carmen said it was a Merlot from Sicily. The meal cost somewhat higher than traditional Vietnamese food but less than you’d pay in the West. Also: paper, not plastic,straw used :)",
      "Halfway through our trip we could not resist the temptation to eat Italian and we decided to try this place and.... surprise!!! We really found a place that made us feel really at home! Credit to the kitchen made with quality products, and the Owner who welcomed us and made us feel like lifelong friends! Super recommended, to feel at home and why not to make friends as happened to us!!!"

      "A large, charming and well decorated restaurant which offers a wide range of fresh fish, shellfish and shellfish. Here, you simply choose the cooking method and pay the price based on the weight of the chosen animal. Prices per kilo are displayed directly on the aquariums and the waitresses tell you directly the final prices according to the quantity chosen. The staff is very pleasant and smiling. An excellent experience and exceptional products!",
      "Da Nang is full of seafood restaurants, so I was wondering where to go, but I decided to go here because the atmosphere looked good. We went in November without a reservation for two people, but we were able to sit at the open table on the first floor. It's a huge restaurant with the whole building as a restaurant, so it seems that you don't need to make a reservation. The casual yet high-class atmosphere was great. You choose the fish from the fish tank. There are pictures on the menu, so I think it's best to choose the food you want to eat and then the fish. Most of the staff can speak English and are kind. The menu is well-written, so it's fine even if you only speak Japanese. We ordered a bottle of wine and a la carte dishes, and it cost about 10,000 yen for two people in Japanese yen. I think it would be more expensive if you ordered shrimp or something. The streets around here are lively, so you can take a stroll on your way home or stop by a beach bar.",
      "It's a very delicious restaurant. It was so delicious that I went there for dinner three days. My was very kind and told me about the market price of seafood, so even Japanese people can feel at ease. If you don't eat the market price, it will cost about 5,000 yen for two people. On the last day, we had a luxurious lobster meal and it cost about 12,000 yen. The portions are large, so a small size is enough for two people. I want to go again. Thank you My 😊"

The manager Thuong was an absolute star and so helpful, knowledgeable and welcoming and so we're the other staff. I can't wait to come back here! 😍",
      "The best handcrafted cocktails in the city! My friends and I stumbled upon this place after we had an evening walk by the river. We only came in for one drink but ended up having 6+ drinks. All the drinks on the menu are so good but best drinks were created by Lee, who was our bartender. He is so talented and is able to concoct any cocktails to our preference. All the servers there were really fun and cool. Ask for the one to beatbox and do magic card tricks. This cool and chill bar is one of the best cocktail places we’ve ever been to. We will be back for sure. Highly recommend coming here!"

      "We visited Rue Du Camp cafe/bistro early on a Saturday evening. We went up to the 1st level seating area. Waitress was attentive and friendly. We ordered a battered prawn appetiser followed by Szechuan beef and Teriyaki beef. Both were nicely presented on a large platter with smaller dishes - one vegetable broth, one salad and the main plate with rice and beef. The broth was very lightly flavoured and not very hot (in keeping with all establishments we've used in Hanoi - lukewarm broth seems to be the way of things here!). The salad was fresh and tasty, the beef and rice were delicious. We had a beer and a Rosebud tea. The tea was presented in a glass teapot on a glass burner/tealight stand. The rose buds slowly infused and opened to release their flavour. It was lovely. All in all we spent VND560,000/GBP20/USD24 + tip as no service charge was included. Excellent value for money.",
      "As we were walking from the Temple of Literature to the Opera House along Trang Thi we noticed this restaurant's beautiful interior wood work and decided to check it out. Returned later for supper and the food was fantastic. Had meet some people in Siagon who were also in Hanoi and invited them to join us for supper a few nights later and the restaurant did not disappoint us again. On the North East corner of Trang Thi and Hoi Vu, it is not difficult to find and well worth it. The cost of the meals was also very reasonable.",
      "First time here as introduced by friends. nice location, close to everything in town. u should note that bearing 50 of trang thi str., but there're a few 50s there and this shop is actually at the joint with Hoi Vu. nice settings out and inside, mix of east and west, lot of sunshines and greens the shop now has lotus theme for drinks and foods. I tried the lotus cofee a mixture of vietnamese cofee with minced and sweet lotus. interesting. we ordered lotus trunk salad, beefsteak and lotus roasted pigeon vemicelli soup. foods was so so 3 over 5 scale"

      "The restaurant's space is extremely cozy, friendly with a bit of Spanish, Latin, and Mediterranean style, looks very pleasant, I haven’t found any tapas restaurant similar with this style in Hanoi. If I had to choose, I would choose to sit outside near the open kitchen bar. Foods is Spanish Fusion, I ordered some dishes, all is truly impressive, excepted sweet potation chips, it is a bit hard, pale and oily About drink, you guys if come here must try cocktail named Frambuesa, it has light pink color, so good and looks beautiful too. Ah, that night I also ordered one shot tequila named “clase azul resposado” just because of curious, really it’s most expensive tequila i have known 🫣 😰, it costs equal one my dinner 😱 but it’s worth",
      "Had a great dining experience in Vamos!! Especially the chic atmosphere in the restaurant, friendly staffs, wide selection of food and drinks and the decoration of the restaurant is so perfect for photos on insta🤭. I personally love the roasted suckling pig a lot which is always my favourite Spanish dish. Definitely will go again !!",
      "At the end of a tour of Vietnam from south to north. I wanted something other than the beautiful Vietnamese food that we had been eating. I was told how extraordinary this place was in Hanoi. I was not disappointed, we started with a few tapas dishes and then had the Spanish Seafood Paella, finishing off with the cheesecake. The authenticity of the food is amazing, I am aware they source a lot of their product from Spain, so it’s no wonder it’s authentic. Has the opportunity of meeting Mr Tam and Miss Thuy. What beautiful people. Please support this restaurant, I am not easy to please, but I thought it transported me back to Spain or South America."

Staff were soooo friendly and hospitable. We def will comeback The Outback.",

      "Had been to El Gaucho in Trang Tien previously and found the lunch set to be good value. Same could be said here at Vincom in Ba Dinh. Had the salsicha this time as the starter. The spicy sausage was a good complement to the mixed green salad and proved a good appetizer for the main course. I had the rib eye and it was cooked to the medium I asked. Nicely seasoned and juicy. The steak fries were too big for my liking and perhaps normal cut fries would be a better pairing for the steak. In any case, good value for lunch. Expensive, certainly. Service was prompt and I had no complaints.",
      "Ate a good steak served with excellence by the young staff there. No complaints. I DO however have a bone to pick with El Gaucho itself: They make things up that don’t exist. There is NO SUCH THING AS “Platinum USDA Prime”. It is quite simply NOT a thing. It does not exist. Which leads me to ask: What are we really getting? Is the “USDA Prime” not really prime? But something lower? Is the “Platinum USDA Prime” (which again, Google it, DOES NOT EXIST except in the fertile minds of El Gaucho marketing staff) actually exactly the same thing as the USDA Prime on the menu? Just an idiot trap? If you Google “Platinum USDA Prime” you will find only references to El Gaucho. They fabricated it out of whole cloth. This “grade” of meat does not exist anywhere else. There is no explanation anywhere about what it is. It is BS. El Gaucho serves BS along with their bull meat. So something is dishonest about El Gaucho. Either the USDA Prime is not “prime” but “Choice” or lower, or if you are dump enough to pay a premium for “Platinum USDA Prime” you will probably get the same steak you would have gotten if you had ordered the USDA Prime for MUCH LESS MONEY. I would love El Gaucho Management to explain themselves. I hesitate to return, due to the corporate dishonesty. Again, my meal was fine (I had a USDA Prime Ribeye, 300 grams, because I wasn’t about to order a side of BS with my steak) and the service was excellent. I just don’t think they are selling what it says on the tin. False advertising. “Platinum USDA Prime” is NOT A THING.",
      "From the moment we walked in, my family and I were greeted by the friendly staff. We ordered off the cheesburgers off the lunch menu. The food tasted amazing and for incredible value. תודה לך ושיאיר פני אלוהים עליך ועל ישראל"

      "We were a group of five who booked a table last min on Sat night that they managed to fit us in. The menu is a little overwhelming as there is so much choice. We opted for a selection of sushi, tempura dishes with edamane beans. All was super tasty and fresh, perfect sharing as a group with a few tiger beers on tap. Bill worked out less than £10 each for decent amount of food and a couple of drinks each.",
      "After three times at this place I can recommend without any doubt, Service is fast, if you are a sushi fan everything is prepared fresh open to the guest. I had several non sushi dishes , always hot And fresh. So if you do shopping in the mall and want to eat something fresh and healthy it is better than fat fastfood you get around."

      "Overall we were impressed with the restaurant and sky bar. The food was of good quality, comparable to some other popular Western cuisine restaurants in the Old Quarter. There were a variety of drinks and they were delicious too. However, we were generally disappointed with the music, as it was a little too loud and the playlist seems to have had only pop songs. There weren't any classical songs or house ones, which are what we expect on the sky bar. If you don't mind chilling in mediocre music then this place should probably be on your to-go list. Oh, and we must also mention that the view here is spectacular. You'll love it.",

      "I love my visit. The staff are eztremely friendly. They speak a little english but that’s okay, all you need are the basics. The people are crazy fun but you will be left alone if you wish to. It’s a fun and safe place to hang out. The crowd maybe wild most of the time but it is a decent place and you’ll feel secure. The sounds ^high five^ took me back to the 90s disco and lead me to present. Plus, you’ll feel at home. The staff will even walk you to your ride (when you go there alone). Thank you guys!!! Will surely comeback. Can’t wait",

      "Cute little diner. Attractive decor. Low prices for steak. I had the rib eye and, yeh was ok but nothing to write home about. The sauce though was shocking and the chips and salad portions so small you could have put it on your fork in one go. I think this is a complaint others have highlighted in TA. The staff were strange, insisting we sit in the corner as there was not enough of us to fill a big table. We were the only customers for the entire time we were there so I don't know what that was about. My girlfriend had the lamb and it was considerably better than the steak.",
      "Visited here after a 2 year gap. The waitress could not understand the simple menu presented in English - ‘French Fries’ was looked at in amazement. The glass of red wine was dirty. We had to remind them about the coke we had ordered. The food was simply plonked on the table as the waitress and her male colleague woofed down bread rolls within clear sight of customers."

I ordered a beer and started with the pork spring rolls, which were really delicious. I ate a lot of spring rolls in Vietnam and these ones were up there with the best. For main meal I ordered a beef dish with chilli and lemongrass and was disappointed. I was served a huge plate of onion, with beef and carrot scattered throughout. Unfortunately I’m not a fan of onion, so I found myself picking around it. The flavour was a bit bland also. Had I just had beer and spring rolls, it would have been much better.",
      "Hot day and really just stopped by for a local Bia Hoi. Sat on the terrace and people watched, which is something even novice people watchers like me can get into. The rhythms of this city are strangely recognizable under the superficial appearance of randomness. Service a bit slow … and it was not busy. But, good local beer and viewing of life.",

    "description": "If you are familiar with haidilao, then you may imagine this chain as an attempt to copy it.  Which is fine, if it is done well.  Unfortunately it falls short of the following issues:\n(1). Soup base.  The Taiwanese special soup was good, but there were too many lotus seeds inside.  The tomato soup, my favourite for hotpot, was average.  \n(2). Meats.  This is the first steamboat restaurant I have ever been to, that does not have chicken in the menu.  The waiter said there is duck, but he himself cannot find it in the menu.  He then served us a plate of duck… (?!).  However, fried chicken is offered in the buffet.  Since I’m on missing items, this is also the first steamboat restaurant I have ever been to, that does not have plain steamed rice in the menu.  Yup, NO RICE but noodles.\n(3). Desserts.  Although there is a large variety, some items tasted “funny” eg the black glutinous rice, the red ruby.  The “raindrop” was amazing, though it tasted rather bland.\n(4). Service.  There are minor attempts to provide a high level of service eg. One waiter came to help us peel the prawns - unfortunately, he came only after we were done with two of four prawns.  No one came to remove the foam from the soups.  Soup refilling needed to be asked for.  Soup ladles were not sufficient.  I note that the condiments were not regularly refilled either.\n\nOur first and last visit,",

Soup base. The Taiwanese special soup was good, but there were too many lotus seeds inside. The tomato soup, my favourite for hotpot, was average. (2). Meats. This is the first steamboat restaurant I have ever been to, that does not have chicken in the menu. The waiter said there is duck, but he himself cannot find it in the menu. He then served us a plate of duck… (?!). However, fried chicken is offered in the buffet. Since I’m on missing items, this is also the first steamboat restaurant I have ever been to, that does not have plain steamed rice in the menu. Yup, NO RICE but noodles. (3). Desserts. Although there is a large variety, some items tasted “funny” eg the black glutinous rice, the red ruby. The “raindrop” was amazing, though it tasted rather bland. (4). Service. There are minor attempts to provide a high level of service eg. One waiter came to help us peel the prawns - unfortunately, he came only after we were done with two of four prawns. No one came to remove the foam from the soups. Soup refilling needed to be asked for. Soup ladles were not sufficient. I note that the condiments were not regularly refilled either. Our first and last visit,",
      "This is the best hotpot in Hanoi with excellent services from restaurant manager and their staff. Truly 5 Star rating",
      "A broad range of options, for all budgets. The most important in hotpot is the control of the temperature and you are provided with an effective tool to modify it depending on the food you put inside (e.g. octopus, red meat, meatballs, etc.). The deserts are average. The tables at the periphery are right next to the shopping mall pathway so not recommended as they are noisy. Better choose inside tables. Need to book in advance as it is popular."

Eat with roll sauce - You order Khanh something lovely + friendly staff - The minus point is that the food I ordered was quite spicy and had a lot of flour, so I got bored eating it quickly.

      "Cincin was an unexpected delight to encounter. Great food and drinks in a modern contemporary setting. The staff were attentive and the ambience was lovely. We were able to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Hanoi to enjoy a small bite to eat. I chose the chilli and garlic prawns, truffle chips and the profiterole's. I also had the oolong milk tea. All was delicious! I would recommend this place to all."

      "The restaurant first floor ambiance is interesting and the food is good. We went on a Saturday night before the show and it was extremely quiet, almost empty. Around 21:00 we then went up to the second floor where is the stage and it felt suddenly more crowded. I might be wrong but it seems that the place is mostly frequented by a young Vietnamese middle class. The staff kindly gave us the possibility to get a table and it looked like everyone else had their seats reserved in advance. Before the band there was 2 lady singers performing each 3 recorded songs as a warm up. The rock band was very talented, the atmosphere very cool but the sound was so loud that eventually we needed to cover our ears most of the time. After an hour we decided to leave before bursting our eardrums... Maybe it is not always loud like that but if that's the case then it is a bit of a shame as it makes it really hard to appreciate what is being played. Drinks are a bit pricy but you don't pay any entrance fee so it balance up the value. A cool place to hang out and if I may suggest bring some ear plugs just in case...",
      "Really cool ambiance here, it seems like a popular music (live band) venue over the restaurant, the food was really delicious but getting the order and getting a waiter after was so hard just to get some pepper and salt. Thankfully one of them speak English the price was quite decent, spent 480000 for 3 people (3 meals and 1 fresh juice and 2 teas) I recommend this place if you have time and patience it's worth it.",
      "We have really enjoyed the quality food, actually snacks, some finger foods, and softdrinks. Seem that evything went smooth but it just overall, this place a bit lack of smiles. From the satff. Great if the manager could look into this issue."

I highly recommend their signature Sous vide duck breast, which is perfectly cooked and rich in taste. And I’m really impressive with good service of Mrs.Dream and Mrs.Vi.",

      "This is a great little restaurant just outside the main hub the serves delicious food and good service for a reasonable price. I have been searching Hue for my favourite spicy Hue style noodle soup and on our last day we found it at this restaurant. We have found that most of the restaurants in Vietnam don’t serve spicy and you have to ask. If you don’t like spicy then most of the menu is just great tasting Vietnamese food. Worth a visit when in Hue.",
      "We visited for dinner and sat on the second floor so we could people watch from the large windows upstairs. The food was delicious and so well priced. Our waiter was friendly and suggested reducing our order as he felt we wouldn’t be able to eat it all…and he was right! We ordered the local speciality beef soup to share and a main course each with rice , plus a beer and glass of wine and spent around £16 in total which was great! There were loads of prawns in my stir fry prawns and vegetable stir fry and the pak choi, okra, carrots and cabbage were very tasty in a light spicy sauce.",
      "Absolutely delightful restaurant serving local specialties (that the wait staff are happy to advise you on!). Sat upstairs overlooking the street. Comfortable and not at all noisy. (this was a real plus given the commotion on the walking streets on a Sunday evening). The menu had delectable vegetarian choices for the friends we were traveling with who had been relegated to rice and steamed vegetables for several days. The food was modestly priced and outstanding (I took their advice on the local specialties, my husband had a clay pot meal- all the dishes were terrific). We REALLY enjoyed chatting with the wait staff, especially Bom who was eager to speak English with us. They were attentive and helpful. Easy to walk here from our hotel via the pedestrian \"walking streets\" from our hotel"

      "We visited on a very quiet Tuesday afternoon (just us in there!). We are suckers for a craft beer place as generally places with nice beer do great food, and we weren’t wrong here. They had a great barman (as well as the owners) on hand to talk through their beers, and even brought out three for my husband to try before he ordered. I had the freshly squeezed lemon juice which was lovely. The food was excellent. My husband had the chicken burger, the bun he described more like a scone like texture but said it was so tasty. I opted for the fish tacos, again these were full of flavour. I imagine when this place has more people in the atmosphere just improves more. We’re really glad we visited!",
      "Fantastic range of craft beers, friendly atmosphere, great happy hour deals and we were fortunate enough to come for Taco Tuesday - carnitas tacos at about $1.50 Australian dollars each were absolutely delicious. Pizzas looked fantastic too although we did not try them. Not in main tourist area but worth a 15min walk or taxi.",

The food was awesome (especially the pizza and ice cream) and our server Lý was so kind to us and our kids. We went back daily during our time in Huề."

      "We heard about this historical building in Hue, it used to be a famous sport club (swimming, rowing boat, tennis, etc.) during the French colonial era. Now it’s a high-end restaurant aptly named Le Cercle Hue. We had dinner here on our first night in Hue. Impressive interior with high ceiling, elegant wooden French doors leading to an outdoor terrace overlooking the Perfume River. Relaxing atmosphere, romantic setting with white table cloth, red rose, candle on every table. The napkin on each plate was folded into the shape of a white tuxedo jacket! We enjoyed our fabulous dinner, especially the traditional Cơm Âm Phủ ( Hell’s rice) and Bánh cuốn thịt nướng (rice crepe with grilled pork skewers). Our waiter Lộc suggested an excellent French white wine to pair with the dishes. He also happily showed us how to fold a napkin into a tuxedo when we told him we loved the look of it. Many thanks also to our waitress Ngọc who recommended the fantastic hibiscus lime ice tea (hibiscus infusion with lime juice and ginger-kumquat syrup). Such unusual, complex flavors yet so refreshing! Highly recommend this place.",
      "Excellent location by the Perfume River between two bridges. The local draft beer was very drinkable and the food excellent and reasonably priced given the location. We were served by Long who's English was very good and he was very willing to tell us about the dishes that we had chosen and life in Hue in general. He was very attentive and considerate of our well being given it was a hot day."

      "We chose this restaurant because it was welcoming and original with a very appetizing menu combining Vietnamese tradition and a choice of burgers. The waitresses are adorable and the food is very tasty, made from fresh produce. We had lunch and dinner for three days because this restaurant was close to our hotel but also because we wanted to explore the map. The bill is completely reasonable. A plate of fresh fruit was kindly offered to us during our last meal. The musical atmosphere is also very good, far from the synth covers heard over and over in other places.",
      "This is the 3rd time that I have been to Nook over a number of years and it was great to see that the staff still make you feel very welcome as soon as you walk in the door. It had changed location since I'd last been however it didn't make it any easier to find! They have a wide ranging menu, including both Asian and Western dishes, open from 7am for brekky and close at 10pm. As mentioned, the staff were very frindly and great to have a chat to, and they were also very attentive to your needs, especially Min and Ha. The Nook is set out over 2 levels, with the larger seating area up the top and the kitchen/smaller seating area down the bottom. I had the pork spring rolls and a burger. Both dishes were good, although it would have been great if the bun was a little bigger on the burger from the look of the fries, I would probably say it was time to change the oil in their deep fryer. The only negative really is it would have been nice to have empty plates and bottles etc removed from the table a little quicker. Overall, I recommend that if you are in the area to pop in for a bite to eat or have a drink, you will be treated very well by the staff and also, all the food/drink is reasonably priced.",
      "Very good restaurant. Though a little off the beaten track there are signs directing you to Nooks. The menu is arguably quite limited and a fair amount of it is \"Western\" but there are enough Vietnamese dishes to keep your taste buds tingling. Nice friendly service."

      "We ended up here via webs and had meals twice here with abs no complaints!! There are 2 outlets and we came by .45. The place is lovely and inviting. We ordered the 10 pieces taster menu and Bahn bo, both were served quite fast. The dished and dips are so flavorful!! Our host Dihn gave exquisite care, went out of his ways to get us some items which are not on the menu, added so much to our appreciation. We were taught to assemble the rolls, every stuffs. I guess we were quite lucky tasting local foods with such reasonable prices. Give it a go when in Hue and see why this place gets great reviews for its food. Thanks the whole team for warm welcome!! Highly recommended!!",
      "If you’re in Hue and want to sample all the best of the local food, this is the place. For about 190000 VND ( about $13 Aust) you can get a set platter that contains all samples of the local cuisine, everything from the hand rolled rice paper rolls to the fresh fruit for dessert. This place is quick, high quality and great value, but the best bit by far was Oanh our waitress, who took the time to explain the process for constructing every bite and was friendly and delightful throughout to a group of Aussies worn out by a day of high humidity touring. If you want to do yourself a serious favour while you’re on tour, drop in here, order the set menu and an ice cold Huda beer, and ask if Oanh is on duty. Truly worth it.",
      "There are 2 Madame Thu branches 140 metres apart in the same street. Madame Thu number 1 at 4 Vo This Sau street is the more authentic building but both serve the same menu. We ate very well trying the local delicacies which were delicious - only one slight problem was that starters and mains arrived simultaneously. Notwithstanding this the food was excellent and with mineral water and a bottle of French wine we paid about €14 a head which is exceptional value. Credit cards accepted. Staff very helpful in explaining how best to eat some of the esoteric dishes Highly recommended"

      "This was the best dining experience weve had on our second visit to Hue after 14 years. A beautifully presented restaurant, great atmosphere. The staff are all very professional, friendly and take great care to make you feel welcome. The extensive menu has something for everyone. Vegetable, beef, pork, duck, chicken, seafood and tofu dishes deliver satisfying traditional Vietnamese flavours distinct to Hue. There is also a cafe section at the front for coffees, juices and pastries from 8am in the morning. I recommend trying the caramelised pork belly, the salt roasted chicken dishes and the kumquat and apricot juice but everything on the menu looks and tastes delightful and is very reasonably priced. We have many favourite restaurants in Vietnam and will always return to this one.",
      "This restaurant is a wonderful find We were served by sally (Hien) who spoke brilliant English and was really helpful with our choices and the quantities required which is always difficult as the portions vary so much from one restaurant to another The food was the best we experienced in our three week trip in Vietnam and also one of the most reasonably priced We discovered that we were sitting next to the owners and the fact that they eat there speaks volumes There was a really good mix of tourists and locals eating there We would recommend this restaurant to any wanting to eat Vietnamese and specifically Hue style food",
      "I’m visiting Hue for a couple of days and was curious after reading reviews of Chan. I called to make a reservation (I think we may have been able to just walk in, but it seemed around 80% full when we arrived around 7PM on a Sunday). The ambiance is comfortable, with many intriguing artifacts on the walls ( I asked staff about some of it). All the staff, especially our server Ngoc, were genuinely warm and friendly. I was a little surprised when, stepping out of my Grab, somebody smiling appeared with an opened umbrella (it was raining), holding it above me as I walked to the entrance. The menu seems extensive compared to what I’ve seen in most restaurants on my visits to Vietnam; I recognized some of the items but there were many new ones I haven’t seen elsewhere that I think must be local regional dishes. I like to take my time and look at everything on the menu, and the staff didn’t hurry me a bit to order even though the restaurant is quite busy. The Vietnamese friend I was eating with, from a different province in Vietnam, was more excited at the menu and the food as it arrived than I’ve ever seen him before in a restaurant. He kept expressing his delight at the food, and even said that if he lived near this restaurant he would eat there every day. I enjoyed everything we ordered, though I think my favorite was a fried tofu cooked in a tomato based sauce. I highly recommend trying Cham if you are in Hue, whether you are from Vietnam or are a foreign tourist."

      "Our first night/dinner at The Pilgrimage Village and we’re off to a great start…. the Passionfruit Juice was punchy & the local beer was a winner (& nicely chilled as it should be!). We opted for the A La Carte (there is a half buffet option with an A La Carte for those with huge appetites) and we shared a starter of minced pork skewers which you wrap in rice paper with salad & peanut sauce - delicious if not a bit messy (though a cold towel is on hand). Then for mains we had the deep fried Red Snapper which you similarly prepare and eat in rice paper, though this time with salad & fresh mango slices, then dip in a chilli sauce and also the Beef Curry which was a stand out winner - mild not spicy and the beef was so tender with not an ounce of fat to be seen! All the waiting staff were super friendly, especially Lien who was so polite & sweet. We were going to eat out in town tomorrow evening but I very much suspect we’ll be back in The Junrei to sample more amazing flavours 😋",
      "We had a great time at Junrei restaurant, located in the beautiful Pilgrimage Village. The food was simply delicious, full of local flavors and perfectly prepared. Many thanks to the whole team for their kindness and warm welcome! The waiters have been taking care of us, taking the time to advise us on local specialties, but also on how to taste them to take full advantage of them. A special thank you to Madame Lien, an exceptional waitress whose smile and attentiveness truly brightened our meal. Thanks to her, this culinary experience was even more memorable. Thanks again!"

      "We forgot making a reservation before coming to the restaurant but didnâ€™t have to wait long, the waiters were very quick to bring out the dishes after only 10-15 minutes ordering. The menu was varied, we ordered a few dishes along with Com Nieu, I have to use the word \"excellent\" to describe that dinner. The restaurant's space is also charmingly decorated. It's really in the top list of Vietnamese Cuisine Restaurant in Hue.",
      "I highly recommend this restaurant for its exceptionally fresh and quality prepared food. The hotel staff in the restaurant had an excellent service for our breakfast buffet and we enjoyed thoroughly many different varieties of fresh fruit, coffee all kinds of different Vietnamese style food and pancakes. The children really loved it and we would come back again especially the hotel and the swimming pool are excellent When you can enjoy the view from the garden from the HOTEL restaurant.",
      "I've visited multiple Spice Viet restaurants across Viet Nam, and I always find myself returning for their food and interior designs. The restaurant always deliver amazing vietnamese food while also having choices for western cuisine as well; although it's obvious from the name that Viet food is their specialty. Saying specialty is also an understatement as their cooks deeply understand the cuisine, capable of refining it to perfection. I always recommend Spice Viet to all travelers if they're looking for the best that Vietnamese cuisine has to offer, and with a reasonable price as well."

They even reissued a dish after some confusion on orders. Food was lovely and the chan special was real value for money at Vd95k, drinks were also more reasonably priced than other places. Catfish was succulent and little class were very filling.",
      "A real delight 😋 10th day in Vietnam and since 3 or 4 days we can no longer get enough of rice and others, we opt for European cuisine. Today we go to this restaurant, to take over the local cuisine, carefully chosen according to notes and reviews. And now, what a joy to reconcile to Vietnamese cuisine! We ask our waitress Huyen for advice on typical Hue dishes. All happiness and flavors... um... for the proposals made. In addition very beautiful setting and a note more than incredible (25€ to 2 with a bottle of wine included) => No hesitation 👍",
      "We ordered the set meal number 4 and it was great. The braised pork was sweet and tender, the soup was tasty, morning glory, and best of all was the fried fish and rice paper pancakes. This was served with fresh watermelon juice and finished with fresh fruit and the subtly delicious dessert. Our waitress was Huyen and she was friendly, spoke very good English and answered our questions about the dishes with enthusiasm. Highly recommended"

      "It's been the best dinner we've ever had in Vietnam. It is more expensive than other places in the city but with a great value for money. The restaurant is located in a hotel with abundant vegetation and an outdoor pool, with a remarkable and elegant wooden building that already provided an unbeatable environment. We took a Shiraz red wine from the house which for the price is totally recommended and the best we have drunk in Vietnam after many disappointments with much more expensive wines. As for the food we share some Vietnamese prawn rolls, highly recommended. Each one also ordered a later dish: my partner ordered a bò Hue bò (traditional meat and noodle soup, flavored with coriander) and it came out delighted; I ordered a grilled chicken with lime leaf that was delicious, with a magnificent sauce and accompanying vegetables that I also can not fail to recommend. For dessert we had a fruit cake of the right passion but not remarkable and a dessert of chocolate type coulant that was totally worth it. The treatment of the staff was always very cheerful and polite and we had the opportunity to see during the end of the dinner a live concert of 5-6 musicians and music who played typical instruments and sang local songs, enlivening and improving the evening. Definitely a dinner to remember in Hue and all over Vietnam. 100% recommended.",
      "I have been to this restaurant during Vietnam trip with my family. We were really satisfied. We were looking for a fairly elegant and well-served restaurant, where we could taste traditional dishes and fortunately we found it! The place remains outside the chaos of the city and presents itself very well. Dispersed in a well-kept \"Vietnamese\" garden, the restaurant is easily reachable by taxi (cheap). Here you can eat meat, fish, but also children's and vegetarian menus. All served as it should, with tablecloths and cutlery, but without losing the oriental charm. The service is very attentive, the waiters are kind, helpful and attentive. As well as in the kitchen, where they prepare very good and aesthetically fascinating dishes. Price above average here in Vietnam but totally affordable for those coming from the West. Worthy of note if you are looking for a refined restaurant. Great experience!",
      "After so much street food and some \"filthy\" contexts it is legitimate to indulge in a little luxury. The 32 euros each for the tasting menu are well worth the service offered. The venue, inside the luxury lodge, is truly cared for down to the last detail. Courteous and very attentive service. The phon so praised by books on Vietnam finally takes shape and flavor, it is cooked with great dedication. Everything else is a virtuosity of cooking design and a vague overview of Hué cuisine. The only flaw to point out is the geographical location, not well marked on the maps and difficult to reach even by taxi drivers. If you have difficulty, have the restaurant call. Overall a very nice and refreshing experience."

      "Great service amazing pizza. Really nice surroundings and atmosphere. Really good value for money. Would definitely come back to this place again. Oh did I forget to mention the nice and friendly waiters. If there was one thing to comment on it would be the IGers. (People who take photos for instagram or any other) but overall amazing. As a family and individual it was brilliant. My 10 year old daughter thought it was the best pizza place she had ever been to.",
      "As tourists in Hue we spent lovely time in this restaurant and we really enjoyed the pizza here! We really appreciate the relaxed atmosphere and the extremely kind and professional waiters. Si Huy followed us in each step of our dinner: he introduced very well the menu, enhancing the originality of the offer and he took care of us in every part of our pizza experience. We really appreciated the pizza, very tasty and rich in terms of ingredients! A really nice pizza experience in Hue, highly recommended!"

      "A ‘nice’ location with good food. We initially had a nice lunch here, but with a few strange twists and turns. Upon arrival we were asked to place our rental bikes out of sight so that their parking space remained free. That was strange in itself because there was more than enough parking space, but soit; they must have a good reason, we thought. After a delicious starter and main course, the staff started to act a bit weird when we wanted dessert after. This was weird, but we got it. When we had finished dessert and asked again for the menu for a drink when choosing a next activity we were presented with the bill and ordered to leave. When we indicated that we meant the drinks menu, the staff suddenly pretended they could no longer speak English while communication was effortless at first, and they aggressively pushed the bill back in our faces. My tablemate wanted to go to the toilet after checkout but this turned out to be no longer possible. All we can think of is that they wanted our table for the group that just came in, but half the tables were still free. As for hospitality, this restaurant actually deserves a big two, but the food was very tasty and the location looked neat so that's why I'm going for four stars anyway.",
      "Our tour guide dropped us here for a pre paid pre booked lunch along side many others people That said the set menu was very tasty and showed off the cuisine very well . Green mango salad was the winner Staff friendly and showed us how to eat some of the dishes Drinks very well priced",
      "This excellent restaurant built in a colonial style serves top class food for a very moderate local price. The service is top class and the owner showed us around his restaurant telling about the many antiques he has collected over the years. We found this restaurant by accident since it was located in the same street as our hotel and we were immediately attracted by the colonial, beautiful style it was built in. The prices of the food were very affordable and a decision was quickly made to have our breakfast then and there and didn't regret it. we also found out from the owner that he owns a second restaurant in Hue City which we visited at night for dinner and deserves a separate review.

      "I walked into this cafe after lunch at a restaurant close by. The ambience was sleek and minimalist, so different from what I have seen so far in a lot of cafes. It was spacious with tables meters apart for privacy. The music played over the sound system was comforting. There was also ample retail space for its merchandise. From a range of beverages on the menu, I ordered a glass of chilled coffee with coconut cream. The cream was thick without being too rich. A slice of burnt cheesecake completed my tea treat. The service was pleasant and natural. What a lovely place to while away the afternoon.",
      "In Hue in the bar area there is this place that makes excellent fruit smoothies. You can also find croissants, desserts, coffee, tea and more. The place inside has a relaxing atmosphere and is ideal for leaving the chaos of Hue for a moment.",

Says it opens at 6.30am, this is when staff arrive, more like open 6.45am-7am for service. Service is friendly and efficient."

Our Mom is from Hue and it’s impressive to have a restaurant in Hue with the quality of restaurants we have in the U.S. and better. We ordered the combo set for 2 and the family set for 4 and it was more than enough food for our family. Each dish, especially the Banh beo, smoked goose breast, thit heo luoc was DELICIOUS. We loved everything and on top of that the decor and the super friendly service was exceptional. You must try this place when you come to HUE!"

Everything was good, the food, the beverage and the service. \n\nI was satisfied with my order. The coconut coffee had just the right amount of ice, unlike some places. The diced chicken, vegetable and rice combination for my main dish was cooked well. The service was prompt and fuss-free. \n\nThe little touches made a huge difference. Before the meal; it was a packet of wet tissue, to wipe my hands I was pleasantly informed. At the end, the same wait staff presented me with a fruit, saying it was dessert. How unexpected and a lovely surprise indeed. \n\nThese touches and everything else make me want to recommend this cafe and restaurant to everyone visiting the Imperial City.",

Overall, it was an excellent dining experience, and the bonus was the view. I had a table that faced the walls of the Citadel. Everything was good, the food, the beverage and the service. I was satisfied with my order. The coconut coffee had just the right amount of ice, unlike some places. The diced chicken, vegetable and rice combination for my main dish was cooked well. The service was prompt and fuss-free. The little touches made a huge difference. Before the meal; it was a packet of wet tissue, to wipe my hands I was pleasantly informed. At the end, the same wait staff presented me with a fruit, saying it was dessert. How unexpected and a lovely surprise indeed. These touches and everything else make me want to recommend this cafe and restaurant to everyone visiting the Imperial City.",

      "A real festival for the senses awaits you at Risotto Restaurant! Fresh and local ingredients meet Vietnamese influences creating aromas that dance on the tongue. The presentation is colorful and generous, the service attentive and friendly. Must try: signature seafood risotto with a touch of lemongrass, accompanied by a refreshing Huda beer Cheer !!!🍻🍻🍻 1.2.3 Zo",
      "Absolute gem of a find in Hue. After a little bit of research we opted to have dinner at Al Risotto and what a fantastic choice we made. Waitress was so kind and helpful and helped with the choice for my wife who has an intolerance to garlic. After choosing our mains we were brought complementary bruschetta with tomatoes as well as a free drink each. When our food arrived it was cooked to perfection. Crispy noodles with chicken was the tastiest meal I’ve had since our arrival in Vietnam almost a week ago. My wife had braised vegetables with rice and we shared a lovely freshly prepared Mediterranean salad which were so tasty. To finish off we had more complimentary fruit served. All in all a great food experience in Hue, we have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone."

The appearance is very traditional and the environment overall is very welcoming. From the menu with the presence of traditional Vietnamese dishes I chose the great mix of appetizers, and I really appreciated that the waiter explained to us the order in which the individual rolls had to be eaten and above all which sauce they had to accompany them with. Everything was very good and the evening was pleasant, reservations necessary.",
      "Had a great meal here on the second night of our stay in Hue. We were sat on the terrace area (I think inside has aircon, but temperature was fine where we were). We both had the set platter (VND190k/£5.60) with some very helpful guidance from the staff on the right ingredients for the pancakes and how to construct them and also how to eat the banana leaf items). Local Huda beer was around 70p. Service was good. Would happily come again."

The place is minimal but comfortable, the staff super friendly and attentive. We took 5 different dishes to share so we could taste everything and we were impressed by how good they were. Savory and tasty dishes but not heavy and at the end they also offered us dessert (a panna cotta with caramel on top) which was also delicious like everything else. I also highly recommend it because for the 5 dishes we had, plus drinks, the price in the end was very low, so the value for money is also very good.",

Although quite small, the restaurant was always busy; service was quick and the young staff were very friendly and helpful. The food is quite simply the best that weâ€™ve eaten while in Vietnam; tasty typically Vietnamese dishes-great portion size and so, so cheap! We stayed in Hue for 3 nights and although it may seem boring, we chose to eat there each night trying different things from the extensive menu. We were never disappointed!"

      "I loved my visit to Bistro La Carambole. It’s located in the heart of the action in Hue City. The restaurant was busy so there was a great atmosphere and buzz, and the decor is lovely. The genial owner Chris, together with the manager and staff ensure that service is attentive and friendly. Prices are very reasonable and there’s a good balance of western and Vietnamese dishes. I had a delicious French onion soup - very moreish on a rainy night in Hue - followed by very tasty grilled chicken with fries. Portions were generous. We also had soft drinks, wine and beers and the total cost for two was very reasonable. We sat at one of the tables outside to soak up the atmosphere on the street and moved indoors when it became a little too humid. I definitely recommend Bistro La Carambole for anyone visiting Hue.",
      "The restaurant was packed when we arrived at 8.45 pm without a booking but we got a table for two. We enjoyed the grilled duck with orange sauce and the chicken in a mushroom cream sauce. The duck was boneless small slices. The chicken was the standout. Two pieces of breast in a rich tasty cream sauce with two types of mushrooms. The mains are served with a choice of rice, mashed potatoes or fries or mixed vegetables. The mixed vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fries were hot and crisp, but the mixed vegetables were better. The French Sauvignon Blanc was acceptable for 115K VND per glass. The meals were delivered quickly despite the large number of customers.",
      "We were recommended to this restaurant by our tour guide. And it didn’t disappoint! The service is excellent. Both of our meals were delicious (can’t find anything to fault them) my husband’s steak was cooked to perfection. This restaurant is good value too. At the end of the night the staff called us a taxi, and as it was raining they even walked us out to the car under big umbrellas! Definitely worth a visit if you’re visiting Hue"

      "Alma Restaurant in Hue is a fantastic dining spot that offers a perfect blend of elegance and comfort. The restaurant features a diverse menu with well-crafted dishes full of rich flavors. The ambiance is sophisticated yet warm, making it an ideal place for romantic dinners or business meetings. One of the highlights of the experience is the excellent service—especially from Quynh, who is exceptionally attentive and friendly, ensuring that every guest feels welcomed and well taken care of. If you’re looking for a high-quality dining experience in Hue, Alma is definitely worth a visit.",
      "This dish is absolutely delightful, offering a perfect balance of rich and well-seasoned flavors that truly stand out. The use of fresh, high-quality ingredients enhances its taste, making every bite a pleasure. Moreover, the beautiful presentation showcases great attention to detail, reflecting the artistry and craftsmanship behind its creation. It’s not just a meal; it’s a true culinary masterpiece that excites both the palate and the eyes.",
      "During trip to Vietnam we decided we wanted to have a western meal and decided to give this a try as it was based in a Melia hotel (which we had stayed in whilst in Hanoi with a good experience). Stunning views across the city and excellent menu choice. Food was great! My only one criticism is that they brought our main courses when my husband was still eating the last of his starter! Even the bread roll and butter was of a high standard (not doughy and sweet as is so often the case). Went upstairs to the Skybar for after dinner drink which was equally stunning. Photos don’t do it justice. Definitely worth a visit and worth the extra money."

      "Food is always the top of our list of priorities when travelling and Vietnam is no different ,though some may think of Pho as the all consuming Vietnamese dish. I was looking for a fine dining restaurant to indulge and narrowed down to 2. Ben Xuan Garden House was my choice after reading some positive reviews. I received an email reply from Ngo who said he would be happy to set a table for us. It was all POSITIVE from the word GO ! Ngo called me and suggested the best approach to Ben Xuan was via a 25min boat ride down the perfume river. On arrival , Ngo warmly welcomed the 4 . We were served refreshments. He even helped snap a few Photos ( which he knew) would become a great conversation piece when friends ask about our visit to Hue. He then introduce his very charming wife Camille to us. We could sense that she was someone very special with multi - talented kills in painting , planning and restoring the Garden House to it's glory. After , a tour of the the compounds , Ngo ushered us into the main recital hall. As we did not see other guests, I thought we would be waiting a while for others to arrive. As it turns out it was going to be just the 4 of us ( overwhelming pleasant surprise ) . The \"private\" recital was like some surreal VIP entertainment . After 30 odd minutes or so, I was eager to savour the special cuisine prepared for us. Each of the dish served was exquisite and we couldn't help but snap enough fotos to fill a small album. A final comment is that Ben Xuan is not your typical fine dining restaurant but an all encompassing experience . We wish Camille and Ngo all the best of health as most Asians cherish a lot and success in their operation and passion in what they enjoy doing. I strongly recommend anyone who is thinking of visiting and meeting Camille and Ngo not to pass up the opportunity . Best wishes to Camille and Ngo . Lilian & Andy ( Singapore) Liz & Gabby ( Melbourne) .",
      "We took a boat to the front gates of this marvelous and interesting home/studio on the banks of the river and it was truly enchanting. We were met by the proprietors Camille and Truang and started with a tour of the amazing property (designed by Camille). We enjoyed an authentic dinner after a performance by Camille and her fellow artist and performers. The music was an interesting mix of north and south Vietnam pieces, juxtaposed with a piece from the southern US. Traung and Camille were the commensurate hosts and could not have made us feel more welcome. This is a great experience for anyone who appreciates the arts (many of Camilles paintings) and music and is an experience off the beaten path.",
      "We had the pleasure of attending a recital and dinner at the beautiful home of Camille and Truong on this past Saturday evening. It was indeed the highlight of our trip to Vietnam. The music on ancient instruments and Camille’s beautiful voice were magical. Their home is a masterpiece designed by Camille. She is also an artist. Her art is beautifully displayed in their home. They were so welcoming and the food and wine was divine. Reservations are required and I highly recommend it if you are visiting Hue."

      "After many days eating local food I wanted to try something closer. I chose the spaghetti with tomato and meat. The spaghetti was very good, different meat than what you usually find in Vietnam, it was minced meat with the same flavor that you can have in Spain. For dessert I chose a pancake and vanilla ice cream that tasted amazing. The portions are not very large, taking into account the price, but the treatment of the waitress (she couldn't have been more pleasant and friendly) and the taste of the food make the experience a 10.",
      "Fantastic food. Y and Hang greeted us and looked after us. We chose Pork skewers on lemongrass & Vegetable spring rolls to start, with 2 Huda beers. For mains we had Pork caramel clay pot and Pork Yellow curry, both with rice. A bottle of Chilean SB - amazing food, so fresh tasting. Service was amazing by Y and Hang who both practised their English with us and taught us some Vietnamese too. We will be coming back as we are here for 4 nights. Highly recommended. They take visa debit cards and charge an extra 3%. Fantastic value as our meal cost £23 for the two of us. Well done to the team!",
      "Absolutely excellent. The food served was all divine- very likely the best Vietnamese food yet! The grilled fish was superb as was the pork and eggplant fried. The pancake for dessert was quite rubbery so wouldn’t particularly recommend that. Will likely revisit."

Really good value enjoyed several beers the banana flower salad and complimentary spring rolls both of which were delicious. Then had several curry dishes and other stir fries all were excellent. Great value for money and fabulous service from Chan.",

I want to thank you for the service, professional chefs, staff, and the young ladies in the store. The boys greeted me very kindly, leaving behind wonderful times and memories.

The road to get there, a side street of the nightlife area, is not particularly lit and initially does not inspire much confidence. We have chosen to order \"set menus\" in which smaller portions of different dishes are served that you can order individually. All dishes were very good and tasty. Value for money highly recommended. Two menus, two beers and a large bottle of water about 180,000 dong/pers. The service is good, one of the owners explained how to prepare and / or eat the various dishes. Small point about cleanliness, we are in Vietnam so we cannot expect the same standards as other countries. It is normal to find cutlery and more on the table in special containers. The place still looks pretty clean. If you want a typical cuisine, not too touristy and convenient... you are in the right place!",
      "This was our best dinner in Hue! Tucked away in a little alley, if we hadn’t have been told about it we would not have found it. Our family of 5 shared 7 different dishes and they were amazing. You have to try the Bun Bo Hue. Fantastic service and the food came out so quick, our boys were happy to have full bellies. The second best part is that our meal and drinks for 5, cost half that of western venues in local area, and we weren’t haggled off the street to eat there. Just great food!"

      "Very attractive restaurant with nice decoration and seating outside and inside. The menu was very attractive and extensive and the service very friendly and English-speaking (but not always very attentive). We ate there three times because not many restaurants were open during the holidays (Tet). I had a delicious vegetarian teriyaki bowl with cashews, peas, corn, tofu, broccoli, rice, etc. and a ginger tea. My friend had spicy seafood (really spicy) and a coffee. I also tried the vegetarian burger, the tofu with soy sauce and my friend had the vegetarian curry and chicken with fries. We found it very tasty and as a vegetarian I was happy to finally be able to eat something other than spring rolls, fried rice or noodles. I can definitely recommend the vegetarian burger, the bowl and the ginger tea! In addition, the service (a young woman) was able to offer us a bus ride to Ninh Binh directly from the island due to her good English skills. Due to the holidays (Tet), planning the return trip was a bit difficult as many travel agencies were closed.",
      "We selected this restaurant according to the great reviews and were absolutely not disappointed with the food and service. We ordered the burrito and mango sticky rice, both were delicious. The burrito is little spicy. You can est on the terrace. Great value for money.",
      "I had coffee and breakfast here two days in a row, food was lovely, a berry smoothie bowl and avocado and poached eggs on toast were particularly welcome after two weeks of noodles and rice! Espresso was also great. Excellent and friendly service from Huong, who happily accommodated a couple of substitutions/ additions I asked for."

At Ladybird, they chose coffee beans well so the quality is superior and well scented. Thank you Nhung for the warm and pleasant welcome. We recommend!!!"

      "We had a lovely meal a CASA bonita! We both ordered seafood curry after hearing good things and it did not disappoint! One of the best meals weâ€™ve had on our trip and the spice was jsut perfect! They also had happy hour on cocktails. We got two beers and two curryâ€™s and it was 8 British pound for all",
      "Nice house, as the name suggests. Cozy restaurant with amazing dishes. We ordered the chicken, mango and avocado salad, carbon spaguettis with bacon and potato balls and cheese with sauce, it was all great. We were surprised by the quality and price. Definitely recommended.",
      "I was in Cat Ba 3 nights and went to Casa Bonita for 2 of those nights (may have gone for all 3 nights if Iâ€™d discovered it the first day ðŸ˜‰). The food was great and very inexpensive. I had the seafood curry one night and cashew chicken the other - both were very good and were under 100,000 vnd. They also have a selection of baking that you can purchase (banana cake, carrot cake, apple pie, etc). I had the banana cake - it was really good, quite large and only cost 40,000 vnd. And, to top it all off, you may get to cuddle with some adorable kittens while youâ€™re there."

      "I used to go here three times with my sister. This restaurant is very famous for the Western dishes such as beefsteak, french fries, hamburgers and grilled foods. The entire atmosphere was filled with the smells of food. The taste of the food here was beyond my expectation. They were totally up to my standard! The most popular dish in this restaurant was beefsteak which was cooked perfectly with medium well level. What I was really satisfied with at this restaurant was the way the staff and waiters serve us there. especially the female restaurant waitress named Kim Chi. She was very friendly and made us feel that we were our home. Moreover, the relaxing music there really made our dishes taste more flavorful. I will definitely come back to this amazing restaurant more in the future.",
      "The restaurant has brought me and my friends a wonderful dining experience. With Thao's subtle instructions on how to choose dishes, she helped us have a dinner that was just enough but still standard and European. Thank you very much for your service.",
      "The food here was exquisite. It’s a bit expensive compared to Asian prices but not at all compared to European prices and the food is on a par with a a top European restaurant. I had foie gras which was divine and fish and chips and my husband had the steak. The way it was served was amazing with the chef coming to the table with the steak on a hot plate explaining the origin of it and setting Cointreau alight to make a sauce. All topped off with a delicious creme brûlée. The service was the best we have had anywhere with the staff so kind and attentive. We are so glad we ate here and will always remember it. . I highly recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Haiphong."

      "- Delicious food, reasonable price - Luxurious, sparkling space, although not really Chinese style, there is music to compensate, gentle and relaxing - Serve quickly, thoughtfully, and pay attention to customer experience throughout the process of using the service - Chinese dishes typically have to be prepared meticulously and take time, so you should consult the menu and order before arriving. The menu consultant is very enthusiastic, paying attention to the taste limitations of diners. For example, can't eat spicy foods, are allergic to shrimp/fish,... - Dimsum and Ribs Yi Ling Ling is the best ❤️ - Not to mention the extremely diverse, delicious and beautiful drink menu ❤️",
      "My family and I had the opportunity to visit Hai Phong, so friends suggested a restaurant for dinner. I quite like the space here, luxurious and sophisticated. Delicious food, suitable for taste and reasonable price. What really impressed me was the service style of the staff here. Especially that day, my family received Quyen's enthusiastic advice on the menu, help choosing dishes, and even dinner, he was always warm and friendly. I will definitely come back if I have the chance."

      "I visited Healing Kitchen in Cat Ba town three times during my stay, and each time was a delightful experience. The food is incredibly fresh, made from locally farmed ingredients that really shine through in every dish. My favorites were the chicken poke and the salmon poke, both bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The team at Healing Kitchen, especially Anni, Hung, and Z, were fantastic. They were warm, welcoming, and provided great recommendations not only about the menu but also about places to explore around Cat Ba. Their hospitality really added to the overall experience. I stayed in Cat Ba for over a month and tried many places, but Healing Kitchen was definitely the best. If youâ€™re looking for fresh, locally sourced food with a warm and friendly atmosphere, this is the place to go!",
      "Love this beautiful little cafe in the heart of Cat Ba town. The people are sweet and kind. The good is amazing, and it's clear that a LOT of love goes into preparing it. We loved the hot steaming ginger tea, coconut coffee, the Rustic Breakfast Bowl, the Poke bowls. It's all delicious and so lovingly prepared. I highly recommend this little hang out joint in the centre of Cat Ba. The energy and ambience is laid back, gentle and relaxing. The music also suits the relaxing atmosphere. Wish we could have gone there more often had we been staying in Cat Ba for longer."

We just had some drinks, chips and even though steamed rice wasn’t on the menu, my friend was craving it and they provided. Service was great despite some minor language barriers which we worked through with Google Translate."

      "We were looking for a place to dine along the coast of Cat ba and noticed this place that immediately impressed us. We entered and were seated at the table. The food was great, I got the shrimp pad thai and it was the end of the world along with a meat dish served over the fire with really delicious sweet and sour sauce. The waiter Hoang was really nice and helpful. The place is highly recommended and is one of the few where I ate really well on Cat Ba Island",
      "I visited this Thai restaurant on Cat Ba Island, and while the food was decent, the real standout was the service. Our waitress, Thanh, was incredibly kind and attentive, making the meal a pleasant experience. If you’re on Cat Ba Island and in the mood for Thai food, it’s worth a visit—especially for the warm and friendly service."

      "We were taken here by a cab driver who randomly said he knew the perfect place for us to eat dinner— we owe the driver so much. What we found was really great local seafood and incredible drinks. The staff is super friendly and if they recommend a drink at the bar order it (especially the pho cocktail). You will not be disappointed",
      "Sooooo good, we went twice! Our son said the only fault was it's not in our city back in England. We had the yummy chicken lemongrass, gorgeous grilled fish with rice paper rolls, delicious vegetarian curry, sweet and sour pork, divine cocktails and the loveliest waiters who are family to the chefs. Such beaming, welcoming smiles! Oh, and it's lovely to sit out or almost out with the doors open.",
      "This one was tricky for us to grade , accommodation was very nice and also clean , as usual the locals are up early and with such a nice prominence on the road side there’s always some one zipping around at all hours ,unsettling to perhaps a good snooze. Terrific staff all with character as in a family business. Meals available but we dined out. Breakfast was very slow and far too lethargic, food needs to be upgraded and main portions are too large , a wrong item came to table , other residents politely fumed . Pho was rustic. On a much better note the Black craft beer on tap is excellent, memorable, a true showcase of local talent. The seating area is lovely to rest in. The wee jack and hill biscuits with the coffees are a nice touch . Needs a few tweaks but you get genuine hospitality."

      "My wife and I ate here the other day. It has a western slant on a Vietnamese menu. But you can get burgers and a pint, so a bit of everything really. The staff speaks good English, the prices are written so you can see them, and they give receipts if you ask. It has a western toilet and an upstairs billiard/party room. It is nothing flash, it is a good times bar but perfectly fine to eat at. Give me a helpful vote if you liked my review thanks.",

      "I got relaxing time at this beautiful Buanglow. I love the site of location, it is near the Beaches, quite and comfortable. I give 5 ⭐ for construction and atmosphere there. All most hotels on Cat Ba island are high building and decorated by small plants or lighting lamps. This Bungalow is different with swimming pool and big giant trees. The staffs are helpful and friendly. They are the useful local guide for your trip! Food and drink are delicious and good price. Highly recommend!",
      "My boyfriend and I are in Vietnam for 3 weeks and we decided to got to Cat Ba for 3 days. We booked at all nights at the Le Pont Bungalow (also amazing spot). While here, we went to the Oasis 2 bar every day for drinks and food (amazing happy hour specials!!). We decided to stay a fourth night in Cat Ba so we could have a night at this incredibly peaceful and gorgeous bungalow. The beds were cozy, heater worked well and the water was hot! I went for a cool dip in the pool before breakfast as a nice wake up after a fun night out! I can’t wait to come back to Cat Ba in the future and stay here!! Thank you to all the friendly staff and thank you for the delicious drinks!!!",

      "Lepont is an excellent restaurant just outside the center of Cat Ba. Great service that tries to do everything to make guests happy. The waiter Duong DC was particularly professional, thanks to him we had a nice time there every time. Very tasty meals, lots of choice. The location and decor make it a pleasant time to spend there. Prices similar to other restaurants. The price-quality ratio is very good. you can count on happy hour between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.",
      "We originally stopped here for a drink as it was 1/2 way between Cat Co (beach 3) and our hotel in Cat Ba town. The view is amazing, and the beer's cold. By chance we were lucky enough to catch the sunset which was just beautiful. We noticed that they had fish and seafood in tanks, and decided to come back to eat. We had Grouper (with steamed rice and morning glory) which was just delicious, probably the best meal we had had in our holiday to Vietnam (apart from maybe the Halong Bay cruise). In fact it was so good, we decided to eat here on our last night. This time we had red snapper and prawns, again delicious. The staff are really friendly and helpful and speak great English.",
      "Perfect restaurant to enjoy a breathtaking sunset. Staff is super friendly and speaks English. Great value for money. Modern, clean toilets with fresh, small, disposable cotton towels. Highly recommended!"

      "A definite must when in Cat Ba. Great place for a drink - awesome Happy Hour!! 10,000 dong big beers 5-9PM (think cheapest $1 beers youve ever had) and 50% cocktails 3PM-Midnight. The \"Thai gourmet\" cocktail is amazing. Mr. Win is great with drink and food suggestions. And if you decide to eat there, Phong is a magician in the kitchen. Ended up coming here 2 nights in a row. Definitely recommend.",
      "Nice place with a very, very expanded menu. They serve good food, just don’t try the nachos. We have been here three nights on a row to have a drink on the terrace. They have special actions like 10k VND for a draught beer and 50% off cocktails. From 22:00 to 22:30 the beer was free. They have a pool table inside and play really nice music. Sometimes just a little loud. I would recommend going there!"

Not only are the food and service good but the European style and the intimate atmosphere here can also bring about good views. Moreover, it is located on Le Dai Hanh street - right in the heart of the city - and just under 1 km away to the Opera House and the square. It's convenient to discover this city. By the way, I would like to give thanks to staff Lan Anh for her enthusiasm and help while I were enjoying my time there!",
      "My colleagues said having coffee here in the morning was great. They were right. I sat here last Sunday morning, drank coffee and worked on laptop. It was so comfortable that I spent the whole morning here. Oh I had a strong impression on a staff named Minh Hieu. I didn’t take any notice that my scarf had dropped and he picked it up for me in silence as he didn’t want to disturb me. Thank you so much and I hope to meet you the next time.",
      "I went around noon, so it was easy to check in. The space is cozy, there is a view everywhere, beautiful and minimalistic design. The tone of the shop with white and black colors creates a comfortable feeling. I recomend that everyone should go early in the morning to have many beautiful pictures. Especially the staff is very enthusiastic, I am impressed with you The Tai"

      "During our recent trip to Cat Ba Island, we stumbled upon Nyugen Chat Coffee while searching for a banana boat ride. Though we didn’t find the ride, we were delighted by our brunch experience at this charming café. Ambiance: Nyugen Chat Coffee has a welcoming vibe with cozy decor, making it an ideal spot to relax and enjoy a meal. The atmosphere was perfect for a leisurely brunch. Service: Elvis and his colleague provided exceptional service, going out of their way to accommodate our vegetarian preferences, which is often a challenge in Vietnam. Their attentiveness made our visit even more enjoyable. Menu: We ordered a coconut coffee, cold coffee with chocolate, and a banana smoothie, all of which were refreshing and delicious. For our meal, we chose a vegetarian pizza and French fries. To our surprise, the quality of the food exceeded our expectations, proving that finding vegetarian options in Vietnam is possible! Dinner Visit: Impressed by our brunch, we returned for dinner and tried crispy vegetable rolls, vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce, and a vegetarian hot pot. Each dish was flavorful, but the hot pot was a standout—an amazing first-time experience for us. Value for Money: Both our brunch and dinner offered good value, with generous portions and quality ingredients. Conclusion: With its great food, inviting atmosphere, and friendly service, we highly recommend Nyugen Chat Coffee, especially for vegetarians and Indian travelers. It's a gem on Cat Ba Island!",
      "We’ve been looking forward to trying vegetarian food at cat ba , and was so glad that we did! The food was so delicious and the service was really great, too!” Elvis was so polite and helpful, going above and beyond to make us welcome. Thanks Elvis for the wonderful care given to us. Forever repeat customers ❤️",
      "Elvis the waiter is super friendly, he took care of us very well and made us laugh. The sunset skybar is wonderful. We didn't stay but it looks good, 51 Dollars a night I think I remember. Cheers!"

      "It’s our first time to visit Vietnam, we arrived at Hoi an. Our hotel was Bel Marina, they recommended us to try out this restaurant which was located in the buzzing area of Hoi An. When we were there, the staff welcomed us warmly and the decorations was vibrant and illustrated the culture of Vietnamese. The staff then went on to recommend some of the signature dishes which is a must try. Oh Boy! I love their Pho Ga (noodles with chicken), it was light yet flavourful and warms up your stomach and alleviate my fatigue especially after a long day touching down in Vietnam. My husband ordered their bun cha, we have never seen nor eaten this dish in Singapore. So it was really a surprise and the sauce goes really well with the rice noodles and a great pairing with the meat platter. Each meat has different texture and taste varies slightly. It was a delightful and dimensional dish. At the end of the meal, the staff served us complimentary fruits! We were amazed by their service and hospitality! Thank you so much Miss Oanh! Oh and yes she speaks perfect English and took pride to explain each dish patiently. Definitely would recommend anyone in Hoi An to drop by and try!!! It was so nice that we went to their Danang outlet as our journey was from Hoi An to Danang. Needless to say I ordered my favourite pho ga. My husband tried their garlic butter prawns. We also tried their spring rolls and fried wantons! It’s really yummy. Though it was fried but it doesn’t taste cloying nor greasy. Please try !",
      "You know the food is good when the tourists dined in from Hoi An and also their new place in Danang! Ordered their pause special starter which consists of fried wonton, fried spring roll and fresh spring roll. Their fried wonton is really amazing, is easy to eat and every mouthful is a burst of flavours that will just explode in your mouth. Their fried spring roll is nicely executed! Though it was fried but it doesn’t taste greasy nor cloying! I ordered the pho ga again! It’s just me! Really love their soup that warms your stomach after a long day! We also ordered their stir fried prawns with garlics, the sauce goes really well with the garlic (add a sunny side up like us) because it goes really well with the sauce and rice and everything! I would definitely recommend this place to first time tourists to try out! The guy speaks good English and very welcoming, I don’t feel intimidated as I don’t speak a single word of Vietnamese. Prices are stated clearly, so don’t worry. Food: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Atmosphere: 5/5 Vegetarian options They can cater to non meat eater too! Dietary restrictions Can share with them",
      "The service was outstanding and the food was top quality and very delicious. We had the mango papaya salad with tofu. It was very tasty and juicy. The mixed plate with starters was amazing especially the wontons. Very fresh shrimps in delicious tamarind sauce."

      "Came across this restaurant whilst walking through the town and stopped for an afternoon cocktail. Funny thing was I didn’t realise until seated that I had read good reviews on trip advisor and had chosen this as one of the places we would eat at over the weekend as it is was close to the dragon bridge for the fire and water display. Had a fabulous meal all dishes had great flavours we had share plates all were delicious cocktails were yummy and hubby had a desert which he enjoyed. Staff were attentive and friendly. Price is midrange four cocktails, four small meals and one dessert AUS $104",
      "I highly recommend visiting this restaurant. The food is incredible, full of knowledge and very well made! We ordered a starter, recommended by the house, the “falafels”, a dish to share with “ribs”, the best I have ever eaten, they melted in the mouth! and to drink passion fruit juice it is a soda. While we waited for our orders, we were offered some kind of fried bread with a delicious tomato sauce! We loved the experience. The only problem was that on Google the restaurant said it was closed, but we decided to go anyway and were surprised to find it open. We have alerted staff to correct this issue.",
      "This was my favorite restaurant in Danang before Covid. And amazingly, they only have gotten better. The menu has been revamped with stronger seafood options. The scallops and whole fish special were both cooked and presented perfectly. The pork ribs were awesome and great value for the money. The crispy pork belly was the best I’ve ever had. In addition, they now are offering heart of darkness beers on draft. Hart of darkness is my favorite microbrew in Vietnam and I am so happy they’re not offering it at fat fish! Also the cocktails have improved. The signature Fat fish cocktail is now served with a BFC (big f’ing cube) so it retains the strength and flavor that was intended. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants ever visited in all of my travels."

      "I came here yesterday for New Year’s Eve with a couple of friends and family and the food was absolutely Devine it was perfectly cooked and the presentation of it was unbelievable. In the restaurant everything was so organized and our waitress Ariana made our experience at altitude so much better with her perfect manors and a bright smile she was so polite and made sure we had everything we possibly needed so a big thank you to her. Happy new years all x",
      "The snacks at Altitude bar, including cocktails and French fries, were very delicious, and the cocktails were also very delicious. Peach...? The cocktail was so delicious that I want to drink it again the next time I visit Nha Trang😍 Even though it was a hotel, the price was reasonable and it was very nice. I also liked that the staff were friendly. I especially liked that Linh was friendly💗 Thank u Linh💗",
      "We went to Altitude for sunset drinks, and had a fantastic time. They had a huge drinks menu, there is definitely something for everyone. We had a very early morning start the next day, so asked them to make 2 non-alcholic mojitos, which were great. The view from the bar is amazing. You won't get any other view like this in Nha Trang. The only downside is that there was someone blasting very loud music from the beach, and even all the way up at Altitude bar, we could hear their music! Otherwise, it's a great place to relax and enjoy a tipple after a long day out in Nha Trang."

The food decoration make the expensive feeling rising in my mind, the taste of the foods are wonderful and excellent but I don’t like watermelon juice because it doesn’t sweet like usual watermelon, the waiters are friendly and kind, they served me very nicely and professionally. Thank you for the excellent experience",

Me and my wife were not expecting any of that lmao. So we gave this place a try. My first thought was that the staff here were all nice, I couldn't even think of a time that they stopped smiling with us. We ordered a big grilled-cheese rock lobster, and the staff even peeled it for us. We didn't have to do anything lol, and all we needed to do was eat. The price overall was not expensive to me, despite us ordering two lobsters. And that's it. You all should give this place a shot if you ever have the chance to visit Nha Trang.",

Highly recommended!"

      "My child said he wanted to eat lobster, so I came here. I said I couldn't eat lobster because I was full, but I kept eating because of the song sung by a great singer and the friendliness and atmosphere of the staff. Everything was good except that it was a little hot. Especially Peter and Ellis took care of it. He was very kind. He took care of the surroundings so that I could take pictures, and when he served the last cocktail to see if the food was delicious, he let the kids try it one at a time. The kids had a great time, and the songs they sang were good. We were listening to pop songs that my father likes. I think you would have really liked it, so I hope you come with me next time."

      "We were recommended this place by our friends, upon arrival it smelt absolutely incredible and the choice on the menu was great! The food from start to finish was honestly some of the nicest and tastiest food weve eaten since visiting Vietnam. The steak was cooked to perfection just how we wanted it and the pulled pork loaded fries for starter were definitely my favourite dish! 10/10 would definitely recommend and return here in the future",
      "We fancied a meat/BBQ selection whilst on our Vietnam trip and came across this place. We were certainly not disappointed! We shared the 2 person meat selection which is served with coleslaw & pickles. The meats were cooked & smoked to absolute perfection and we just didn’t want it to end! We ordered a side of fries to share and there was more than plenty of food. The staff are great, the wine was good and well chilled. The place has a great vibe and quick service. A couple of bits that would make it perfect: -the bathrooms could do with a paint/mini refurb -the restaurant is above another and it’s a little hard to find/misleading at first. More signage would be good! If you are visiting Nha Trang and like your meat - 100% visit here, you will not be disappointed!"

Give it to the packing container. Better. Better. Rice juice also has s size so it's really good to eat it! I recommend eating it a little. It's delicious. Two and a half, chicken rice sauce. I ate this, but it's Taiwanese. The vanceous sauce is dirty if you mix special sauce + fish sauce + sardine tea!",
      "I liked rabbit, and it's really delicious. One of the foods you ate at the Natrans can be put in five fingers. Make sure to try Crayfish Combo. I've come over to eat this because I booked Fullville to black. Still remembering taste. I'll eat it again. Next time I'll do one day. If you mix the morning glory and the rabbit and the swahili, good luck!!!"

      "Very tasty, cheesecakes are flying out every day. I booked 2 days in advance so that they would postpone it for us 😊 very often there are no empty seats, it is advisable to book a table in advance for breakfast too. I took oatmeal, they can cook it with oat milk, without sugar. You can also make scramble purely from egg whites. My husband took pancakes, which were also delicious. This is the second time we’ve come for breakfast, I highly recommend it!",
      "DELICIOUS 😋 and very pretty inside. European cuisine is common to many, not pho bo soups for breakfast. Many Russian-speaking visitors and Europeans. The pancakes are delicious, tender (2pcs per serving) enough to eat in the morning, the price is 80-100 dong per serving depending on the filling. There are cheeses 105 dong, also delicious, but the portion is small, cheeses the size of an elephant's nipple :))) one portion of vryatli is enough for you. Pumpkin soup is delicious, Vietnamese coffee is delicious. We've been here three times already and I love it.",
      "We had breakfast here and ordered the zucchini omelette, bruschetta and granola with strawberries. Everything was delicious and the portions were very generous. Our iced latte was also very large, with perfect milk foam and a small delicious cookie. The staff were also super friendly and accommodating!! We'll be happy to come back."

      "Food is delicious! We had the fried vegetarian spring rolls, vegetables with wok fried glass noodles, fruit icecream and soya bean curd with caramelised sauce. Great to get some nice vegetarian food. Plenty of seafood and meat for those who like it. The atmosphere is lovely and amazing indoor architecture. You can't go wrong 😀",
      "A very atmospheric place not only with exquisite interior, service, but also cuisine. Starting from pleasant music, unobtrusive but gallant waiters, presentation of dishes and a beautiful and understandable menu with a large assortment. I definitely recommend it, even if you unexpectedly come across such a stylish and organic restaurant in such a resort town. Yes, the portions are not huge, but everything is sooooo tasty, the price tag is above average, but it’s worth it 1000 times.",
      "It was a perfect dinner at Mam Restaurant. We tried a lot of delicious dishes here. Also, the staffs (especially ms. My Hao) were enthusiatic, they recommended many must-try dishes. We were impressed by the design as well as the warm atmosphere. If you are considering where to have dinner, you must try once at Mam restaurant, it won't let you down 💓💓💓"

I was especially impressed by the employees carefully taking care of how to eat delicious seafood. While busy, the staff asked me if I needed help with a translator in Korean, so I could feel quality and sincerity. If you want to have an unforgettable meal at a affordable price in Natrang, this is the place to go. I like buffet, I love it!",
      "Recently visited a Vietnamese buffet with friends and it was a wonderful experience! The atmosphere of the establishment is very cozy and friendly, which immediately creates a feeling of celebration. The variety of dishes is astonishing, from fresh seafood to fragrant salads to hot dishes. We tried a lot of different snacks, and each one was incredibly delicious and fresh. Service is also at the highest level – attentive waiters were always available to help, that. The desserts were particularly pleasing: light and sweet, they perfectly ended our evening. We had a great time laughing and enjoying the delicious food. Definitely recommend this buffet to anyone who wants to taste authentic Vietnamese cuisine and seafood in the company of friends!"

The menu offers a great selection of traditional Spanish dishes, perfectly seasoned paella. The ingredients taste fresh, and the flavors are well-balanced, making every bite enjoyable. The service is also a highlight – Ms Tracy supervisor is friendly, knowledgeable, and always ready to recommend the best dishes and explained the ingredients very carefully. Overall, this is a must-visit spot for anyone who loves Spanish cuisine or wants to experience something new. Highly recommended!",
      "I went there to commemorate the anniversary because I heard it was awarded 1 Michelin star. I really enjoy trying new foods and seek out a variety of flavors. The amuse bouche was delicious and all the food was good. In particular, the staff member in charge of us was very friendly and I felt really good. I think she said she was Choi and she said she was famous for the drama Queen of Tears haha. Thank you so much for even gifting us an anniversary dessert! It was a day like a gift❤️",
      "We had the pleasure of dining twice at the Gran Melia Nha Trang's Hispania restaurant (Spanish restaurant). Once à la carte and once with the Chef's testing 5-course menu, and both were incredible experiences! Spanish cuisine has pride of place here, and every dish we tasted was a true delight. Featuring quality products, the authentic and delicate flavors really delighted our taste buds. A huge thank you to the Chef and his brigade, as well as to Ms Jasmin and Ms Trinh. Their service was impeccable, combining professionalism with human warmth. They took the time to explain each dish to us, which enriched our experience. The ambience of the restaurant is equally charming, creating an ideal setting for a memorable meal. We particularly appreciated the attention to detail, both in the presentation of the dishes and in the warm welcome. In short, L'Hispania is a must for those wishing to enjoy authentic Spanish cuisine in a welcoming setting. We'd like to thank the whole team for a fantastic evening, and look forward to coming back for more! Comte G&M"

      "Really glad i found this joint in nha trang. Food was excellent, our server (i think his name was Tho?) was exceptional, very patient and knowledgeable, servers even went above ans beyond in buying us flowers on request because we didnt know the area well! Bar staff gave us complementary drinks on the house as well! Owners are from Canada and xan speak english and vietnamese fluently and are very friendly and easy going. Steaks were delicious along with the mussles and clams we had as sides. Highly recommend visiting and experiencing this place, it feels like a five star western restaurant with Nha Trang prices and warm asian welcoming vibes.",
      "After weeks of delicious Vietnamese food, that craving for Western comfort started creeping in. Lucky for us, our friend Brandon introduced us to Secrets Bar & Grill, a steakhouse gem in Nha Trang owned by chef Gerry Nguyen. Tucked near the beach and city center, this place is as inviting as it is impressive—elegant decor, cozy indoor and breezy outdoor seating, plus a full bar with a solid wine list. Gerry sources top-quality meats straight from Australia and Canada, and it shows. We kicked things off with a perfectly shaken margarita and a frozen Bellini—both were spot on. Then came the starters: a classic Caesar salad with anchovies and rich French onion soup. But the star? That ribeye. Cooked to absolute perfection. Secrets Bar & Grill is known for its premium imported steaks, curated wine selection, and relaxed, upscale vibe. Whether you’re celebrating or just need a break from noodles, this is the spot. The secret’s officially out—if you’re in Nha Trang, do yourself a favor and check it out. You won’t be disappointed.",
      "This place is a bit expensive compared to Vietnamese prices, but the quality of the food is good enough for the price. Usually, about 300 grams per adult is enough, so I don't know the exact name of the amount and drink, but I ordered two cocktails and ate them with my wife. I went there together, and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff's English level is excellent and friendly. I'm planning to visit Nha Trang again on May 3 for a 5-day, 4-night trip, and I'm planning to visit for dinner. However, the only thing that's disappointing is that the menu doesn't mention food and cocktails. I think I can get more help with ordering if there is a picture with it."

    "description": "We decided to give this restaurant a try on our trip to Nha Trang  as Greece is literally our 2nd home. And boy we were not disappointed. Met by the owner, Stefanos, we were shown to a beautiful table by the window that gave a great view of the street. Our first impression of the restaurant was how like the many Greek Tavernas we have tried that this place actually was, with original Greek colors and wall art.\n\nWe chose the local house wine and excitedly perused the extensive menu. Missing all the fresh fish we eat in Greece we asked Stef if we could try a Fish Platter. Excellent choice! (please see pic below and arrive hungry!) As it was going to be all cooked from fresh we were told to expect a wait of at least 35 minutes. Not a problem, just keep the excellent house red topped up in our glasses! \n\nAnd then it arrived! Wow! It was nearly the length of the table! So on the huge platter there were Clams, Mussels Saganaki, Calamari’s, a whole Seabass, Bassa portions accompanied by a bowl of fries, fresh salad adorning each end of the plate, a selection of dips and bread too. So we set to work! Demolishing everything we could see! It was a work in progress in between the wine. Even the owner was surprised we finished it!\n\nWith this gone we thought we could not manage another morsel! Quickly changed our minds though when we were presented with little chocolate pots to finish off!\n\nAll in all it was an excellent start to our trip to Nha Trang with excellent food and service which is second to none that we have experienced and will definitely visit again before we leave.\n\nThank you Steve, Makis and the team you certainly deliver 100% in all aspects!\n\nJo and Mart x",

      "I physically cannot explain how good this place is. The best food we’ve had in a long time- and you get a free dessert just because! Everything tastes extremely fresh, the staff strive for perfection and the setting really feels like you’re in Greece. After 6 weeks of backpacking, this place cured my soul. Please go here!",
      "We discovered this restaurant in 2015 and rediscovered it at its new location 9 years later. Food is still fabulous and great value. The portions are generous and the Britzola (pork steak) was enough between two adults. The meat was very flavoursome. We also had a starter of fried saganaki which was very creamy and moreish. Finally, a complimentary dessert – a chocolate brownie type pudding with banana. We highly recommend this restaurant."

From sun-up until sun-down it is the perfect beach club and is available for all to enjoy. If you are looking for a place to while away a few hours whilst soaking up an amazing beach and island view then look no further.

Whatever your taste may be, we believe we have the dish for you! And just when you thought it was time to go home, the Nha Trang Sailing Club once again reinvents itself as restaurant becomes bar and night club.

      "Excellent location right on the beach and has seating on the sand, patio or inside. Has an equally vast choice of cuisines and drinks. We had a bespoke, vegetarian pizza made and it was absolutely delicious. Thin, crispy with a perfect balance of toppings and cheese. As it was early evening, the music being played by the DJ was appropriate to enjoy the meal whilst enjoying the sound of the sea and breeze. Though not the cheapest beachside bar/restaurant, it has the perfect ambience to unwind and enjoy Nha Trang by nite. Would definitely come again.",
      "Ideally located , easily accessible and the perfect beach setting. We were there in the evening for a bite and saw the colors change …. Beaches of Nha Trang all brilliant hues. Found the menu very interesting, the passion fruit cocktail i ordered was refreshing.Samosa was mind blowing with the accompanying mint chutney.Prices are also moderate however it’s well worth it for the eclectic vibe!!! Service was top notch and also rather quick. There were milkshakes, lavish fruit platters and endless beers being served. Great place for people watching as jogger’s go by in the evening and one can see the ferris wheel lit up at Vinwonder. Drop by to hang out and chill!!!",
      "We stopped after a day at the beach to have a beer. Excellent service. It has tables on the beach and the place is right in front of the sea. It also offers restaurant service with dishes from all over the world: from local, Indian, Italian... prices above the local average."

By far. Highly professional. Impeccable. So discrete and quiet, super efficient and attentive, very customer friendly and respectful. Excellent team coordination & spirit. No time spent on cell phones. No talking, no chat among staff, only a permanent attention on customers. Orders & (special) requests from customers executed and delivered in an impeccable manner. Nothing left to desire. Truly impressive.\n\nSecond the quality of the food I ordered (as a diabetic person I go systematically for the \"simple\" top blade steaks) was consistently very good to simply excellent like on my latest visit which impressed me most this evening, Dec. 13  (reason why I am posting this review on TA 😉💜). \n\nThough I find the free side to be on the light size of the things (I wish there would be more, yes for sure 😂 especially since it is soooo good) everything is very nicely presented and the meat always exactly cooked as ordered (as it should but in that restaurant it is highly consistent). \n\nAs local customs might differ from expectations based on experiences at home, I learned that being very specific about what I expect when ordering is ensuring that I will not get disappointed or feel a bit of frustration, at least in that wonderful restaurant, as they will accommodate every special request. First class service at no additional cost and admirable experience every time.\n\nSo I ask for the sauce of the Cesar salad to be served on the side. More recently I came to realize that I could simply ask for lemon or vinegar and use salt, pepper and oil on the table for a healthier dressing (as I suffer from diabetes).\n\nAlso I specify to be served the meat only once I am done with the salad 😉 as well as to get every single item on the main plate warm... not cold or luke warm. I even request the plate to be (hot)warm as I am a very slow eater (yes in the end it will get cold but... I can/have to live with that😅).\n\nThis is definitely my top restaurant in Nha Trang and the wonderful owner & admirable team combined with delicious food and an amazing customer service minded attitude is the reason. I would eat there every single day probably ... though that would not be a wise and healthy choice. I wish the same exceptional first class service and great food & price would be the norm in Nha Trang... and elsewhere 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️",

He took care of us wholeheartedly from the greeting to leaving, even though there were other tables. Very commendable for Thang. Thank you very much, Thang. I will definitely come back here on the nearest day and I will still choose Thang as my waiter. See you soon 🙆🏻‍♀️",

      "We entered the establishment because there was a queue to enter. Great food, fast and attentive waiters, drinks a little expensive, but beer in a mug from the freezer covers the overprice. We took rice with seafood in pineapple, very tasty! A must visit",
      "Ăn Thôi – A Delicious Surprise in Nha Trang It’s been a long time since we came back to visit Nha Trang. The city has changed quite a bit, and when we asked friends for food recommendations, one name came up: Ăn Thôi. As Vietnamese, we’re used to the traditional look, feel, and taste of our dishes, so we were a little skeptical when we noticed most of the customers were non-Vietnamese tourists. But we gave it a shot—and we’re glad we did. The restaurant is warmly lit with tasteful decor, creating a cozy but not overly quiet vibe. It strikes that nice balance between lively and laid-back. We went all in and ordered a bunch of traditional dishes to put them to the test: • Crispy baby shrimp with lime leaf: A nostalgic hit! It brought back memories from childhood. The lime leaf gave it a fresh, aromatic lift. • Mi Quang (Quang noodles): Spot on. The flavors were authentic and true to the central Vietnamese style we love. Bonus points: they include a little leaflet showing tourists how to eat it properly—Vietnamese-style. Very thoughtful. • Ăn Thôi morning glory: A touch spicy for my taste, but still very flavorful. No wonder it’s a hit with their Korean customers. • Lemongrass pork skewers: Perfectly portioned and prepped with all the ingredients chopped and ready to roll, literally. Just follow the guide and you’re set. We definitely over-ordered for two people—but we didn’t regret a bite. Too often, modern Vietnamese restaurants tone down the flavor to appeal to a broader crowd and end up losing the soul of the dish. Ăn Thôi manages to walk the line beautifully—you get authenticity and approachability in one place. If you’re ever in Nha Trang and craving real Vietnamese food that doesn’t compromise on taste, Ăn Thôi is worth a visit. You won’t be disappointed.",
      "I've come for lunch. Well, yesterday I delivered it to you at the Schlanritz, and it's delicious, so today I've come to eat it myself. Yesterday I ate meat and morningglory fries, so today I've come to eat beef rice and garlic morningglory fries."

      "Best independent restaurant in Nha Trang. Trip Advisor reviews of Dinner at Cims were excellent and so we thought we would give it a go. We arrived early before 6.00pm and were delighted to see this very comfortable restaurant in a quiet back street in Nha Trang. We selected the set menu for couples and quickly discovered the food was amazing. Fresh bread, Scandinavian Prawns on toast, French onion soup, spaghetti carbonara, then tenderloin steak finishing with apple pie and home made ice cream. At around $50 AUD a head it was certainly worth it. Would highly recommend Dinner at Cims as a must do in Nha Trang.",
      "The dinner was 10/10!!! For the starters we ordered a tiger prawns and beef tartar - 10/10 the tartar was one of the best I’ve ever tried before. For the main course we ordered the steak platter - 10/10, the beef was so fresh and soft. We have visited a lot of top places here in Nha Trang, this is the must visit place!",
      "Just remembered out of the blue the Steak House in Nha Trang from TA, DMed at the google map for booking(had no idea it did work, yeh it did), came the spot earlier than booking time, which was a nice choice as the Alley to the restaurant was so curtained and not seen by the big big shops around on the main blvd. Kind English speaking Staffs who recommended today's BlackAngus Tenderion and Tigar, the sweet cat, which came for the rich butter-flavored shrimps. Every experience was quite, peaceful and good to be there."

      "I really like iVegan because (other than just being really tasty international vegan food) they put the kcal and macros on the menus so you can make a choice based on that. My fav in terms of taste: beyond meat burger. My fav in terms of macros: tofu scramble :) It might be slightly more expensive for the local market, but the prices are still 20-25% of what you'd have to pay in the West. PS: if you leave a review, you can get ANYTHING from the coffee and deserts menu. That's very generous!",

Not expecting a table we still asked and after a few minutes wait were accommodated by the proactive front of house manager upstairs in this overall well fitted out dining space. The waitress Nuc? Was very attentive and engaging and made our night even more enjoyable. The food however was really authentic Italian more so than expected. Wood fired pizza, sensational, the home made pasta, next level and a good choice of imported wines and choice of great desserts. Try the tiramisu! A great spot, highly recommend!!",

      "The pizza dough here is one of the best I’ve eaten anywhere in the world … rosemary May be the secret ingredient. The staff are wonderfully attentive and not afraid to advise about food portions (they are BIG) in order that you don’t over order. This was matched - so says the husband - by a 9/10 tiramisu. Tucked along a lane away from the evening business that is Nha Trang, come too La Cala and you may as well be in Italy."

      "Noodle bomb!!! A cafe with a mono menu of noodles and rolls with meat and vegetables! Served quickly, everything is fresh. The noodles are made from the same place by hand, as you can see. Clean for a street cafe. Came based on reviews, I recommend it. We took fobo and rolls, if you want meat, take the more expensive one in a clay cup, there is raw meat there. We had lunch: 2 fobos and 2 rolls and 2 Saigon and Orange beers for 340 thousand ($14).",
      "The noodles were delicious. The menu was easy to understand, with English explanations and pictures. Many people ordered hot stone pho, which is raw beef heated to your liking, but I ordered regular beef pho. I saw a local woman adding lots of bean sprouts and herbs and lots of seasonings, so I did the same and it was delicious. It has a mild taste without adding anything.",
      "had lunch here when i visited nha trang two weeks ago.someone recommended this pho restaurant to me.it is popular among tourists,especially among korean tourists. there is a speciality dish for Korean in the menu,that is called pho in the stone bowl (pho tho da). stone bowls widely used in Korean restaurants. it is my first time to have pho in stone bowl,very unique experience.besides,i ordered orange juice and Quẩy. (fried dough sticks), i always love to put Quẩy inside the bowl,it will become more delicious. pho soup here is not heavy, pho itself is tasty.after the meal, you will become hạnh phúc, which means happy in English,or 행복해 in Korean.worth a visit!"

      "The food is stunning. We both had the Atlas salad with Mexican shrimp, avocado, green dressing and more. It was so good that we came again the day after. Then we had Salmon croissant and green pesto shrimp pasta. Again lovely food. The only thing I could criticise is that the portions could be a bit bigger, but is is still worth the price. The dishes vary from around 70.000 to 300.000, and a few more expensive seafood dished. Average dish is about 125.000. The cafe has a cosy ambiance which is a nice break from the city. Classical music is played and the seats are comfortable yet stylish. Would recommend 10/10.",
      "During our 1week stay in Nha Trang we visited multiple brunch places and Atlas by far stood out from all of them ! There is a decent selection of both savory and sweet dishes and all the food a very flavour full and fresh ! The staff were very friendly and attentive and I would recommend anyone looking for European western brunch in Nha Trang, Atlas Cafe.",
      "A great place for a pleasant time. Here you will find a magnificent cuisine, where each dish is prepared with love and attention to detail. The atmosphere of the establishment charms with its coziness, while cleanliness and order create a comfortable environment. The staff is friendly and attentive, always ready to help and delight guests. I recommend visiting Atlas Cafe - you will definitely be satisfied!"

      "If you want to eat oysters, mussels and shrimp to the ground, here you go. It's delicious here (shrimp must be boiled ourselves). Everything else can be tried to make sure it's not worth eating. I also do not recommend taking lobster for an additional fee.",
      "We went purely for the different types of meat to try so we don't regret our visit, however it is pick up raw meat and cook it yourself at the table. It's a nice idea but not when we're paying more than usual for the lack of service. We had to ask for my husband's drink 3 times before it finally arrived. The food itself was nice but we did need to cook it ourselves, and we got to try some new things (crocodile, snake and frog). They also didn't serve ice tea which seemed unusual! There are similar restaurants in the area which are cheaper and include a drink, but we haven't tried them to be able to compare",
      "Ate here this evening with my partner. Walked passed once and noticed it was very busy. We went back and were seated right away. Staff were very friendly. We had no issues with the service like some other reviews mentioned. Our server was very helpful and helped us cook some meats/ fish we hadn't tried before etc. Can't really comment on the quality of the fish as we're not big fish eaters. It was however a good chance for us to try a few new things. Was overall a pleasent evening. Beers were 20vnd which was also very good."

      "We spent 14 days at the Bamboo Village Resort, which includes the restaurant, where we regularly had breakfast and ate a la carte. Breakfast is very rich and also offers a variety of hot dishes. The food is themed on several menus, Asian, Western and Italian, on several nights there is BBQ with live music and an additional BBQ menu. All the dishes were perfectly tasted, we could taste some and rarely ate so well. Our focus was on seafood, especially the shrimp in Tamarind sauce had pleased me, but also the smaller dishes for lunch like spaghetti bolognese or sometimes a burger were very delicious. The service was extremely friendly and attentive, Tuan the supervisor always inquired if everything was fine. Our European stomach tolerated all food well, there were never any problems in this regard. Everything was really very clean. And also the cocktails were excellent:-)",
      "The chef’s cooking was delightful pairing with the other foods in the buffet section. Desserts were always so delicious following up with the fresh fruits lined up. I was always happy to be walking around excited to see what will be served for the day. As well as drinks paired with everything was delectable. For my sister's 18th birthday we were able to ask the receptionist to order roses and a cake. They were very kind, the manager went as far as to give us a discount on the cake due to them not being able to lower the flowers price. They went as far as to have a heart banner with balloons surrounding it saying “Happy Birthday”. I’m incredibly pleased with the amazing food and service they have provided us with each meal.",
      "The food was super delicious, especially the fish and the curry. The staff are very nice and attentive. The restaurant is located directly on the beach, a BBQ was also offered. The breakfast buffet is also very delicious, a large selection, also of hot food and a great fruit selection (changing daily)."

      "We made an exception, and for one night, we skipped the local restaurants. We were really satisfied with this Italian. You can tell that there has been a lot of work to offer a genuine experience, both when it comes to the food and the hospitality of the friendly staff. We tried some different dishes and found out that the pasta is actually home made and also the pizzas are of really good quality, with that genuine Italian crust and flavor. A tiramisu that pleased our son and a good espresso to finish it all off. An extra star to the staff that, during the whole dinner, looked after us and made sure that we were satisfied! The prices are of course a bit higher than the local food, but very reasonable especially if you consider the quality of the whole experience. The complimentary limoncello before we left added an extra bonus! Try this place!",
      "Great place with Italian cuisine! Children liked the pasta, now they ask for it always for dinner)))) Delicious poured beer, but more expensive than the local Saigon. Also liked Risotto with seafood",
      "We have been super well served with very tasty dishes: good to be able to eat real Italian food in Vietnam. By the way, with very nice Sicilian wine... Staff sooooo friendly and accommodating... The word pampering was invented for this!👍😉"

Fresh seafood, salad, vegetable and protein ingredients plentiful. 👍🏻 A variety of smoothie bowls, milkshakes, ice cream and drinks were available too. The lady who works here was extremely pleasant, friendly and helpful. Highly recommend a visit here for a tasty, healthy meal and drink in a great atmosphere!! 🌸 PS. Their cycle hire was a great option. #foodismymood #eatgoodfeelgood",
      "5 out of 5 What a nice, clean, pleasant place with delicious and beautiful food! I had a poke with my own selection of ingredients, and it was fabulous. Nice view out of window also and nice lady working at the kitchen. So much recommended 💛",
      "Eat two pokes, I'll give you a grade-- food average. It's a bit dry, not enough sauce and tenderness! The main product of salmon and tuna was not enough! You can eat once! The atmosphere is cool, a very unusual place for Vietnam!"

The food is fresh and delish, the price is not too expensive compared to other resort's restaurant. They have 3 menus varied from Vietnamese cuisine to western food, and every well executed. Protips: call the restaurant to pre-order fresh seafood",
      "I wish we had found this restaurant earlier, having found this on our last night in this area. It is situated from the front on the main street which runs through Mui Ne, but the restaurant is situated in a beautiful garden a distance down from the road, making it a quiet little retreat from all the hustle and bustle. Soft music playing, candle lit, sublime food, and even a decent bottle of wine, something which we have missed during our 4 weeks in Vietnam, reasonably priced too! The food was impeccable, service perfection, instead of the usual Vietnamese style of bringing all the food out as quickly as possible, irrespective of which course it is, or even whether you have finished the earlier course! Time allowed between each course, we wished the meal would never end. Just perfect, you need to go. Forget all the others, this is the place to go, excellent choice, excellent food, excellent service. Perfection.",
      "The restaurant is part of the small but fine \"Cham Villas\" complex. The restaurant, where you can get breakfast (from 7 a.m.) and lunch, also focuses on high quality. The restaurant is tastefully and discreetly decorated, and breakfast is served here in the form of a buffet. Although the \"Cham Villas\" can only accommodate around 40 guests, the breakfast buffet offers a very large selection. In addition to cheese, sausage, liver pate, a very good range of fresh fruit, Bircher muesli and juices are offered. This offer is complemented by eggs that can be prepared to your taste and Vietnamese dishes in the form of noodle and rice dishes. Of course there is also a very tasty Pho soup. Since the resort had only a few Vietnamese guests at times, the Asian buffet part was sometimes omitted. However, the staff expressly pointed out that we could also have these dishes freshly prepared. An offer that we always gladly accepted. The preparation was also very quick. To round off breakfast, there are small cakes and muffins available, which are also very pleasantly presented. A big compliment also goes to the attentive staff, who look after the guests attentively and also, a rarity in hotels in Vietnam (German owner), speak understandable English. We were extremely impressed by this magical restaurant. Tien and Phi are always very nice and attentive. Tien even speaks quite good English."

      "1: Cleanest place (the toilet is finally not Vietnamese) 2: lovely owner. 3: steak on stone for 1000 rubles - absolutely a bomb. The stone is hot on it and you cook the meat to your needs. Burber - the bun is made by the wife, the fries are really something special, the cutlet (I’ve never eaten one like this before)… in short…. This is perhaps the best place in Mui Ne. Located in the central part where there are a lot of restaurants👍🏼"

      "Incredible view to sit facing the water and look out to the horizon as the sun sets. The food was very good, beyond expectations. We ordered cobia fish to share, highly recommend ordering the amount suggested by the waiter, you will be full and satisfied. The fish was served with rosti, super tasty and I was also able to order corn (more than satisfied). Nice staff and worth about SEK 500 that it cost (food, water and 1 beer). Can recommend the restaurant, the only minus was the music that was played. A Christmas song on repeat but we managed to get them to change it and then it was peace and joy, eating and looking out at the sea is life. Nice service with!!! Pass this place if you want to eat food (choose fish/seafood)!!!!",
      "First of all the resort where this restaurant is located is beautifully designed with lush greenery, outdoor pool and one of the few clean beaches with actual sand. The resort has two restaurants, we have been to the seaside one. Relaxed seating next to the beach or air conditioned inside. Food choices are abundant with Vietnamese choices of course, all beautifully assembled and very balanced. We had some grilled chicken which was juicy and came with awesome dips. Grouper cooked in a sweet lemon broth was good and seafood platter and grilled squid was well done! Will go tomorrow again to try the other choices 😜"

I got the chicken jalfrezi (which was packed with flavour), saffron rice, garlic naan and mint tea and everything was TOP NOTCH 👌 Great portion sizes and very reasonably priced! Staff are so lovely and Naz makes you feel very welcome. Would totally recommend this place to anyone who loves a good curry 💪 P.S I'm a 26 year old female, just posting on my mum's account 😊",
      "Not the first time and not the first year we go to this restaurant. The caring owner always turns on the fan in the heat and brings delicious mango lassi. One of the best local Indian cuisines, big portions, hearty dishes",
      "Goa has a low key and very relaxed ambience with nice low lighting and some outside seating. The food is outstanding; as good as any of the dozens of Indian restaurants we have eaten in at home in the UK. The staff are attentive , pleasant and very efficient. The owner, whose name we unfortunately did not get, is a charming and genial host and it was a pleasure to chat with him. And they do very nice cocktails."

      "I'm pretty choosy about my cuisine, as I've gone to all the best restaurants in Moscow, but it's just DELICIOUS! It's mandatory to visit! Tartar top, steaks are delicious and unusual serving, tiramisu 10/10.",
      "We went here because my parents wanted to have the hot stone steak where you finish searing your steak on a hot stone on the table. It is a fun gimmick if you like that kind of thing. I ordered the mountain burger. The steak was nice, even if the whole table was enveloped in a cloud of steam from the steaks sizzling away on their stones. One problem was that with the blue, dim lighting - it was impossible to see how well done the steak was. If you want it rare and cut it you will be unable to tell in the low lighting. The burger was not the best I have had, slightly dry and uninspired.",
      "What a great find! We came across this bar/restaurant and it looked inviting, so in we popped just for a couple of drinks. We were so impressed by the place we decided to go the following evening for dinner. We both ordered the Hot Stone dishes. I chose the strip loin and my husband the fillet. The pepper sauce I can honestly say was one of the nicest pepper sauces I’ve had. Both steaks were good quality. The white chocolate dessert was gorgeous. It was their take on a Crème Brûlée! The Managers and their staff were attentive and friendly. We will go back if we are in the area again. Modjo does not disappoint!"

Pool is well kept and the section of beach the hotel has is clean. The poolside restaurant and bar has a great menu and everything we tried was fresh, tasty and well presented. Compared to other resorts in the area it is pricey, but you get what you pay for. Will go back again for sure.",
      "We ate at Sandals twice during our stay in Mui Ne and both times the service and food were excellent. We had the Christmas set menu one night which consisted of a series of traditional Christmas dishes - initially I thought we would have to choose from the options but they gave you everything on the menu in perfect sized portions. Second time we ate from the Al a carte menu. We had the sashimi, prawn poke bowl and seafood pancake as our mains and then we followed it with the brownie and cheesecake. Thom was our waiter both nights and she did a magnificent job - she even remembered our drinks order from the earlier in the week and we were welcomed with a big hello. Stef the operations manager also came and greeted everyone in the restaurant on Christmas evening. The whole experience from beginning to end was wonderful and I would highly recommend eating here when in Mui Ne.",
      "Sandals is the Sailing Club hotel's restaurant, open to all, on the beach. Incidentally, the bungalows scattered in a tropical garden, protected by vegetation, make you want to book here for a future stay. The servers are smiling and professional, one even recognizing our son and his wife who had stayed there for New Year's Eve 2021. Jug water is served free of charge. Unfortunately, I was unwell and was not able to enjoy my dish but I envied my family who enjoyed beautiful plates of mango chicken sandwich and Pork skewers in rice. An address to remember."

      "A jewel in Mui Ne – an unforgettable experience! This restaurant was a real favorite of the stay in Mui Ne. Everything is there to spend an exceptional time: a pleasant atmosphere, an ideal location, a team with little care, and above all... an absolutely delicious cuisine! The setting is superb, clean, welcoming, tastefully decorated, and you feel right away. The location is perfect for a gourmet break between walks or at the end of the day. On the kitchen side, each dish was a treat: subtle flavors, fresh products, a beautiful presentation, and a varied menu that makes you want to taste everything. Whether for Vietnamese specialties or more international dishes, everything was mastered perfectly. But what makes the experience truly unique is the quality of service: a staff of rare kindness, smiling, caring, professional and sincerely concerned for the well-being of each client. You feel a real sense of hospitality. In short, this is the kind of restaurant you want to come back to over and over again, and that we recommend to all travelers passing through Mui Ne. A beautiful discovery that deserves 5 stars.",
      "We were received friendly, after which we were given the menu with a lot of choice between Vietnamese cuisine but especially German / European cuisine. We went for the curry sausage and spinach with fried eggs and mashed potatoes. This earned us a big 10! Price quality ratio is very good. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. We definitely recommend this place to eat something different than Vietnamese cuisine.",
      "The wonderful German restaurant is open and not as it says on the page closed. The. Owned by a German-Vietnamese couple who also run the fine bo galows behind the restaurant and a lunch restaurant in the complex itself, we have tried both, re t and nicely eloquent waiters in English and great food."

      "Good restaurant that doesn't need to bait tourists in front of their storefront. This place seems known to connoisseurs and it suited us perfectly. Russian dishes (because the restaurant mainly serves Russian customers), but also typical Vietnamese dishes. We were pleasantly surprised at the very reasonable prices.",
      "Although past reviews talked about non-Russians not getting good service we had no problems. We did go for lunch not dinner though and the restaurant wasn’t busy. We had nice salads and wine for a cheap lunch. We left happy!",
      "I was on vacation in Mui Ne, visited quite a few cafes and restaurants, and this place is the best!!! Incredibly delicious food, huge portions, and surprisingly low prices! Positive staff, Russian chefs, super atmosphere! I definitely recommend this restaurant, you won't regret it 🥰"

All seafood , especially the springrolls with shrimp exceptionally good. Currys and various fried rice dishes with various side dishes extremely tasty. Value for money is very good .",
      "By far the best restaurant in Mui Ne Have tried three , four others but none came close to this. Were there every day last time. The selection of fresh fish is great and the veggi curry just a highlight:) The first time we ate the water spinach with garlic here, highly recommended. The price performance is bomb. Juices, coconut, beer super good. Juices not diluted. The owner and colleagues are always super friendly and nice Highly recommended"

They say they prepare relatively inexpensive lobster, but it must be ordered in advance. I really liked the tuna pieces in sauce, this was the second time I came specifically for it.",
      "An exceptional dining experience awaits at Mui! The pho here is truly outstanding, a delightful blend of flavors that leaves your taste buds dancing. The ambience is refreshingly clean and inviting, setting the perfect stage for an enjoyable meal. Notably, this gem offers incredible value for your money, making it even more appealing. I can't stress enough how highly recommended it is to visit this place in Mui. It's a culinary delight that provides a combination of delicious cuisine, a pleasant atmosphere, and affordability, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking an exceptional dining adventure.",

      "We have struggled to find quality dinner places in Mui Ne outside of our hotel (the Anantara), but La Riva was a great choice. I had the parma ham and mozzarella salad to start and the rigatoni puttanesca as my main, and my wife had the beef carpaccio to start and the parma ham and burrata pizza as her main and they were all really tasty. We had a lovely montepulciano d'abruzzo wine; it was a bit pricey for a restaurant in Vietnam outside of the hotels, but nothing outrageous (c.£35). If I were staying in Mui Ne for longer then I would definitely come back here."

The food is very well seasoned, not too spicy and simply delicious. The chef also speaks German and gives good advice. The staff is very friendly. We will be back.",

Always super delicious, no matter what we ordered. And inexpensive. Time had flown too fast, unfortunately. PS: If you feel like it, you can also have new glasses made at more than fair prices. Thin is also an optician with training in Germany.",
      "After a few days we finally found Thinh's restaurant where you could pay with Visa card. We were warmly welcomed and tried the very delicious menu on several days. It was all very good and of course cheap. Thinh tries very hard and we felt very comfortable among exclusively German guests. Menu in German and Thinh speaks German, of course. So he could also answer our other questions about country and people chatting ;) His herbal schnapps are also great. Definitely recommended."

      "Whole stretch of mui ne is filled with seafood and i was afraid to get the bad ones so i did alot of googling and thankfully i picked out the right one! The snapper was fresh and crispy, the lobsters were big, and the bamboo shoots were so meaty! Scallops on the smaller side but all good! Total meal set us back to $45 SGD which is so reasonable! Staff were very friendly too. Will love to go back again. Freshest seafood i ever had!",
      "I m coming from egzotic place where is good prepared sea food normal to me. I tried so bad food during my traveling that I really didn't excpect nothing special in Vietnam. But, when food arrived and when we started to eat I was positive suprised! Food is amazing. We had shrimps, tuna, squid and few more things. They had butter and garlic on the top, so juicy, tasty, soft, even tuna wasn' t dry. We payed good price for all of that, you can ask for Discount. I was like at home! I ll come back again, next Year."

      "For a start, the food was great - a,largely french menu and well cooked and presented. The ambience was also great. However - the gold star goes to the waiting staff, who run their little socks off in a helpful, friendly and unobtrusive way. They're all good - but Vee is absolutely outstanding ( with great English, by the way). A message to the owners - whatever you're paying these guys, you should double it. I've returned 5 times for dinner purely on the strength of the service. Definitely a 5 star (if quite expensive) option.",
      "Honestly stunning meal! Highly recommend! Food excellent, cocktails delicious and service attentive. For starters we can the beef carpaccio and cheese board, and for mains I had duck breast and hubby had steak. Can highly recommend those dishes. Not the cheapest in the area but you get what you pay for and in my mind it is excellent value. Many delicious cocktails too. If you are close by a must to stop in at, it was about 3km from our hotel so we used the taxi app grab and got here for 34k about £1.30",
      "If you go here you need to try the arrabbiata pasta, it’s one of our favourite dishes at home, and this one became one of our top ones we’d ever had. So much flavour and a good portion size for the good price too! The staff were lovely and welcoming. If I could go back again and again, I would!"

      "Very nice steakhouse. If you are looking for western-style service and food this is the place. Very attentive staff - Andy the Maitre’d and the rest of the staff are awesome. Steak was cooked as ordered and very tender. Wine by the glass is from Chile (white) or France (red) and is very affordable. If I’m in Dalat again I will definitely return.",
      "After a long days travel through the rainy mountainous area of Đá Lạt, we stopped by for dinner after a quick google search. When arriving, we were quickly greeted by a gracious host who guided us through the ground floor which seemed to be a cafe? The space is a cozy intimate dining area. The menu is in both English and Vietnamese with highlighted recommended dishes. Our choices for the evening were the Dá Lạt salad, crab bisque pasta, steak and mashed potatoes. The da Lạt salad surprised us both. It’s quite plentiful and the vegetables/fruit were fresh. The crab pasta was crabby in flavor, but in a good way. It even came with the shell stuffed with crab meat and cheese baked on top. The steak was seasoned nicely and the pepper sauce paired well. The steak was cooked a tad bit rare for my partner, but she still enjoyed it. We enjoyed the pepper sauce, but it was fantastic with the mashed potatoes. The carrots were cooked very well. Overall, we enjoyed our experience. It’s a good value, it’s good for sharing (you may need 3-4 plates for two depending on how big of appetites you have), and the service is fantasticz"

      "I came here because this restaurant showed up on my gluten free search of Dalat and it was near our hotel. What a really nice atmosphere over several busy floors of happy customers. I explained my gluten free needs to the waiter and he took a photo of my translation card and then came back after talking with the kitchen staff, and he recommended the beef and veggie stir fry set, that comes with soup (yummy broth), salad with vinegrette and rice. I was really pleased at the size, presentation, and most of all the taste was really nice! I was full but not stuffed and everything felt light and fresh. It was also pretty cheap, so on a travel budget, it was great! I have to give a shoutout to the amazing wait staff who ran those stairs like athletes, making sure everyone was happy and getting their food quickly! We will be back! {Also I did not react to my meal at all! :) }",
      "I had breakfast at Trang's Cookery today, and it was delightful. I enjoyed their avocado-packed eggs with the freshest 'muffin' bread that wasn't overly sweet. The coffee was top-notch. What stood out the most was the excellent service from the hardworking and incredibly polite server. The only thing I might not order again is the pumpkin soup, as it was a bit too sweet for my taste.",
      "Wonderful friendly service as soon as you walk through door. Free hot tea whilst you browse the menu. My husband and I opted for the hot beef Philly baguette. It arrived beautifully presented with fries and side salad and a very large (cut in two) baguette filled to the brim. Highly recommend this lovely, clean and friendly little restaurant. PS they have delicious looking cakes but was too full to try them! It rained whilst we were in there and a family leaving were given free rain ponchos. It’s the little things 🥰"

      "I went with my family and experienced the delicious food here. I ordered pancakes, lasana, cheesecake. Because my family ate it all, I didn't take pictures of the dishes, only pictures of the desserts...sr the whole family To be honest, this is the first time I've eaten European food in Vietnam with the right flavor, full of Western standards, and the pancake portion is quite large, 3 thick pieces. My baby couldn't eat it all, so his parents had to eat for him to finish the plate I give Cheesecake a score of 10, it's rich in flavor and you can taste the light fatty flavor after eating Lasana is extremely fragrant and rich in flavor. My baby doesn't like to eat tomatoes and this dish has tomato flavor but he can still eat it and he compliments all 3 dishes as delicious. Service is friendly and attentive, but food takes a while to prepare. If improved, it would be an ideal place for tourists to enjoy more. The atmosphere is sunny in the morning but the wind is cool, so I really enjoy sitting and eating while admiring the peaceful view of the hills and small houses In short, my house is quite picky about style, but my husband, me and my baby all like it. It's simple and the food is perfect... I will come back many times when I visit Da Lat again. Thank you shop😄",
      "It’s just amazing, there’s not a negative. Absolutely everything we took was amazing. Burgers, pasta, pizzas everything is homemade, desserts are divine, I recommend 100% and frankly for the price we are students, it is really cheap. There is not a flop, it is a 20/20. It’s the first time I’ve been to a restaurant and everything is good, honestly! It’s definitely the first time I’ve posted an opinion on the Internet so much it’s amazing! Go ahead, eyes closed!!",
      "This is not my first time at Moto Laurie. They were at a different location, movinh maybe a year ago, to a larger and more attractive location. The owners are wonderful people and very dedicated. Since moving, the menu has been widely extended, and they have numerous, exquisite vegan dishes, which I have sampled. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have many bakery items from bread to cakes. (Some of them only to order) I believe it is the only place in DaLat that has home made bagels. Yes, they do have bagels with lox and cream cheese . (Lox=smoked salmon.) I have to say that I have never had a menu item that I disliked. The soups are amazing. Pizza delicious. I have one objection: Nobody comes back to the table after serving to ask if one would care for something else. Maybe that is only expected by westerners only, but I feel it could add to the quality of service. It is not uncommon in Vietnam and a small price to pay for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. Highly recommended. I will be back."

      "Such a fun place with immaculate vibes - the view, lights and music made for a lovely evening in a very Instagrammable location. The food was delicious, however I would recommend asking for a second bbq grill if in a larger group as our fire died down quite fast. The pork belly and vegetables were stand out and the drinks were impressive too. Definitely head here if visiting Da Lat, it's an amazing quiet spot set outside of the hustle and bustle of town.",
      "We arrived at the restaurant fairly early at 4pm and sat upstairs, but the downstairs doesn't open until 5pm. When you hear Da Lat, everyone mentions Bag Mo To, so you should be able to enjoy the grilled dishes there. The seasoned meat is delicious. The green salt and orange here are delicious when dipped in vegetables. That day, I ordered cheese-wrapped beef, kimchi-wrapped pork, and grilled pork ribs. It's been a long time since I've had such delicious baked food. The food here is a bit expensive."

Lemongrass chicken and morning glory were perfect! Unlike other restaurants that beg you for a review or give you a free gift in exchange for a review, this place lets the food speak for itself!",
      "We stayed in Dalat for 4 days and were lucky enough to have this restaurant within a short walk from our hotel. We visited on the first night, as we thought we need to find our bearings, arriving in a new city, and of course with the thousands, literally, of restaurants to choose from this was on our doorstep. The food was delicious, served promptly, piping hot - incidentally not always the case in Vietnam and served with a smile, despite the restaurant being full to capacity. We enjoyed the food so much we didn't try anywhere else in the evenings, so ate there for 3 consecutive nights. The taste of the coconut curry sauce on the steamed rice is to die for and the chicken with ginger so moreish. Couldn't fault any of the food we had. Delicious!!!"

From the friendly welcome we got, to the amazing tasty dishes we ate, I couldn't fault it and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Dalat. We would honestly say this is the best Indian/Nepalese that we have had (home or abroad). One warning, the portions are generous, and the naans are bloody huge.",

Food was great - the lamb tikka and chicken tandoori were perfectly cooked and with just the right level of spice for us (we requested mild). Butter naan was fluffy and delicious and finished off with a pot of excellent masala chai. Definitely worth a visit!"

The standout was the top-notch service. The staff was not only incredibly friendly but also attentive and accommodating. They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in. The ambiance with music added to the cozy and enjoyable atmosphere. It felt like the perfect place to relax and savor a great meal. In summary, 'Chefs Dalat' comes highly recommended for excellent food, outstanding service, and a pleasant ambiance. I’ll have breakfast there tomorrow!",
      "My family had an incredible Christmas dinner at Chefs Dalat! The set menu was absolutely delicious, with so many standout dishes. The tortellini soup in the pho-style broth was such a fun twist, and the A5 Wagyu beef was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. We absolutely devoured the Christmas pudding and loved the homemade mulled wine. The atmosphere was super cozy and festive, with beautiful Christmas decorations. Service was outstanding – Ms. Linh was attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed. Overall, this was such a great experience, and we left feeling so happy and full. Highly recommend for a special night out!",
      "My family, including 2 kids, visited the restaurant in January 2024 and it was a lovely experience. Their seasonal salad was so fresh and crunchy! We sat right next to the pizza oven and got to see our pizza order slowly baking. The head chef came out to check on us and asked for feedback towards the end, which was so kind and courteous of her. Overall, an amazing visit with satisfied tastebuds and top-notch service!"

      "I was drawn to this cafe after reading all the positive reviews left by other travelers, and it did not disappoint. Despite only being a 10-minute car ride from Da Lat's busy center, it feels like a distant overlook amongst the mountains, with a view of the city. Peaceful, serene, and every corner of this place felt well-cared for and thought out. And for far-flung travelers missing a taste of home, the Western food served here tastes authentic and fulfilling. In Da Lat's wide ocean of cafes and coffee shops, this place truly stands out.",
      "Beautiful scenic environment. Right next to the cable cars. Outdoor/indoor cafe, adorned with flowers and plants, a photographers delight. I've had many meals here, though mostly breakfast. Everything I've eaten has been very good. My favorite breakfast meal, is the Rancheros Huevos, though their waffles, eggs, omelettes, are excellent as well. One of the attractions besides the tasty culinary delights, is the location, as the outdoor part of the cafe sits on the edge of a beautiful green lush valley, where photographers just love. The staff are very friendly and conscientious. This is a cafe that I will continue to visit. Coming there, is the highlight of my day. Thank you to both Anna and her husband, Bartlett, for setting up the guests for a beautiful experience.",
      "What a beauty of a hidden gem! The decor, the view, the beautiful smiles from the staff ... We are so glad we found Annas and made a visit Directly opposite the cable car ramp, it doesn't look like much outside but the wonder starts when you walk through the doors We had an English breakfast with an omelette & for drinks we had 2 coffees (he did), and I had an English tea ... Fairly priced we were not disappointed! I can honestly say that this meal, was the 1st time I have ever eaten out at a cafe and had the plate heated to keep my meal warm ... 10/10! We were so impressed we went back for brunch! This time I had an apple pie and he had a blueberry pie with icecream ... So yum!! With a carrot and orange juice ... We'll be back before we leave Da Lat! Well done to the staff at Anna's ... You are as beautiful as your venue 🙏🏽"

The bartenders here are true masters, crafting cocktails that not only taste amazing but also look spectacular. I was particularly impressed with their use of fresh, local ingredients in each drink.

The staff were attentive and friendly, providing top-notch service that made the experience even better. This bar is perfect for any occasion—whether you re celebrating with friends or enjoying a quiet evening. I highly recommend Gemination for anyone looking to indulge in delicious cocktails while soaking in the charm of Da Lat.",

      "Rừng Thông Mơ (a.k.a. Mơ Restautant) is the most phenomenal atmosphere. Situated on the side of a hill in the forest, it is just so relaxing. Its probably the nicest resort restaurant I’ve been to in Vietnam in terms of the atmosphere, and the service matches what you would expect at Four Seasons Nam Hai, Amanoi and similar places. We were staying at the Mơ Stay Forest resort and dined at this restaurant 2 of our 3 evenings in Dalat. A series of small pavilions in the forest, each pavilion has just 1-2 tables and its own fireplace. So the dining experience is private and quiet. With a cool breeze in the air, very quiet music, and surrounded by magnificent trees, it’s an unbelievably pleasant dining experience. The service is attentive and outstanding. They were patient and friendly. There seems to be 1 server per 2 tables and the server is always standing at a nearby station and paying attention. We had several special requests which were well handled – including ordering Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam, which is not on the menu, but was excellently prepared. In terms of good quality, they provide great attention to detail for both food and drinks. The Soda Chanh (lemon soda) was much more of a crafted drink than the typical Soda Chanh - it included a lot of crushed lime, aloe vera chunks, a delicious Vietnamese mint leaf called Chocolate Mint and was just delicious so we had to keep reordering it. The food is high-quality and we especially enjoyed the salads. My only request would be to add more Vietnamese food and more vegetable dishes given they grow the vegetables right there at their organic farm, which we had visited earlier in the day. There is also a large playground for children. This is good both for families and romantic dinners. The total bills were around VND1.5 million, which is great value for money considering this is the same ort better standard as the best restaurants at 5 star resorts in Vietnam.",
      "Quick response on Instagram when I made a reservation. Love food and the atmosphere here. Staffs are friendly, they are always available near our table to assist us but not too close to disturb while we are enjoying dinner. We also love food, they are beautiful. Taste good & nice decoration. Thank you so much for such a wonderful birthday dinner.",
      "The most beautiful and tasty place for more than one month travelling through Vietnam . The perfect atmosphere where the best service, concept, well prepared and presented dishes meet the stunning design of nature , forest and pines air. We had a dinner and enjoyed the life music here. We sincerely thanks to everyone who involved to this process- from the host, who met us at the entrance till the every person in kitchen. Thanks to one who created this place. I believe this is made with love."

      "Very nice Mexican restaurant! The cheese a bean burrito was very good and so filling! We also had salsa a guacamole with chips, the guacamole was so fresh a full of flavour, the chips were super crunchy but not salty but still moreish. Would definitely recommend to eat her for tea with friends or family & yes they have a real blue parrot which is very vocal 😆 the staff were really nice too!",
      "This was such a good find! I am vegetarian and they have a separate menu for us! Mushroom burrito was so good. I also ordered way too much because I was excited (refried beans, queso dip, fries) and ate most of it! Yummy. The service is also really good. I can't fault this place at all, the staff were really friendly and made conversation with all customers. Definitely go here, it's clean and colourful inside too.",
      "This restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, beautifully decorated in theme. The staff was also very nice and friendly, and the food was served quickly. The portion sizes were decent, but they did stand out in flavour. Would have not expected to get close to authentic mexican food here in Vietnam, but it was really good! The waitress also shared some tips for trying other food here in Da Lat, and elsewhere in Vietnam. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a change from only Vietnamese cuisine!"

      "Artist Alley was very near the hotel we were staying at in Dalat. It is set back from the road, and although it has a neon sign on the street entrance, it is quite easy to miss. Being set back from the road, it is quiet. We were greeted and directed upstairs. It is decorated with paintings on the walls. We had both lunch and dinner there (3 visits, that is how much we liked it). The host understands and speaks English well, and they were able to cope perfectly with vegetarian and gluten free dietary requirements. There is a good selection of both Western and Vietnamese food. I particularly liked the spaghetti bolognaise (vegetarian), and their special smoothy is also worth checking out. We didn't get a chance to try any of the deserts. Top notch, highly recommended.",
      "Lovely restaurant, not difficult to find using Google Maps, even though it is up an alley – as the name suggests. Walls covered with paintings and other artwork, and the space itself has been designed and created by Bien, who waited our table and whose family prepare the meals. Unfortunately, drinks list did not include local beer, but did include a small range of Da Lat and foreign red wines. Bien, is friendly and his English is very good - he had visited London. The restaurant is very clean, and tables, coverings and napkins upmarket (proper table linen!). Interestingly, many tables were set with knife, fork and spoon place settings - we weren’t offered chopsticks nor a rice bowl: the hemisphere of steamed rice plus accompanying vegetables was brought to us on a dining plate. Food was pretty good though not outstanding – that’s the only reason I haven’t given a 5 rating.",
      "Artist Alley Resturant is a great choice for diners looking for a unique meal at very competitive prices . The hardest decision for me is choosing between their Grilled Trout or their ostrich steak and vegetables. Both are great and I can’t say enough about the pricing and their multiple offerings on the menu . Their onion soup is also a spectacular offering and is delicious. Grilled Trout with mixed vegetables and a bottle of water tonight was 125,000 vnd or $5.00 usd and I have to say it’s the best $5.00 meal I believe I have ever had. You cannot go wrong here and I always come back as their quality and prices are excellent. The restaurant is very quaint and seating upstairs is plentiful . Multiple wine offerings and mixed drinks. A great asset for Da Lat restaurants and you can’t go wrong with the quality and prices that they offer . 👍👍"

      "Upon entering the dining room you’re immersed in the Quality, subtle creativity and comfort of the space. You set yourself up for an amazing dinner. Wine list is simple, yet covers all the bases profoundly. The menu is set up in Italian courses that you can choose from. The service on the floor guided me in not over ordering and with their attention to detail I had a fantastic meal.",
      "The surroundings are intimate and beautiful. Pleasant music and the beautiful rooms. We ordered four pizzas and they tasted really good. The kids (ages 8 and 11) said they were the best pizzas ever. We also tasted some of their desserts. The chocolate mousse was really good. Unfortunately, their tiramisu was far too sour for my taste. It tasted of yogurt and blackcurrants. However, they were kind enough to offer me another dessert, an affogato, and it tasted great. This was without charge. Sweet waiters and good atmosphere. Top marks from here.",
      "Went there in the cold winter night craving for hot tomato soup (after a recommendation from friend) and the restaurant took me by surprise. By the time I reached, had to wait for few minutes for a table and staff was so nice that they immediately offered hot water to warm up while I was waiting for my table. The soup was delicious and served with the most beautiful atmosphere around. It made me look for a main course and generally I like pasta with red sauce. Being vegetarian it wasn’t on their menu but chef customized it for me and it was absolutely delicious. It was light on stomach and the taste of sauce was tantalizing which made me finish the last drop of the sauce in the pasta. Was also served freshly baked sour dough bread on the side that are also very comforting and tasty. Staff was very attentive, friendly, accommodating. The table setting and overall decor was customised for holiday season and was festive but yet peaceful. Overall a must go place for a dinner when you are in Dalat!"

      "This spot was an absolutely unexpected highlight of my time in Da Lat. Despite my love for Vietnamese food, after a few weeks in the country, I was ready for something a bit different. I didn't assume much at all when I searched for sushi, but Mimi offered quite the pleasant surprise. Their fish was extremely fresh, beautifully plated, and very affordable for the quality. And admittedly, though I doubted that a place that offered sushi could deliver on their italian food, I was very wrong. The pizza and pasta are delicious, I particularly loved the Pizza Messicana. Da Lat is a small city, so almost everything is a short car ride away. Definitely give this place a visit if you're in the area, you won't regret it!",
      "We eated there sushi,pasta,” etc everything was so good and tasty. Table service is polite and fast and food price is 👌 Definetly reccomend Mimi Sushi 😊",
      "We went for lunch as a family group. The welcome and seating was prompt and very friendly. Drinks orders were executed promptly and served ice cold. We ordered Salmon Sashimi, Crispy salmon skin salad, sea grape salad, beef udon noodles, fuji beef and some pasta. All the food was served quickly and was fresh, well prepared and tasty. Certainly on our list for a return visit during our next stay in Dalat!"

      "I was looking for a burger for lunch, and walked by this place. It seemed promising, so I noted its location and returned gor a late dinner. Being from the outskirts of New York City, my standards for pizza are high, bordering on snobbish. I had the pizza with spicy salami. The waitress explained that the salami was not spicy, but that they added crushed red pepper as a finishing touch. The pizza was delicious, on a light crust and baked in a stone oven. If you get tired of noodles and oddly seasoned street food, this place is a fantastic alternative.",
      "This is our first time to the restaurant, we do not understand the food on the menu so we asked the waitress for advice, she is very enthusiastic and cute. We tried the Luganega pizza as suggested by her, with italian sausages and crispy mushrooms, Pastas varied and delicious, I don't remember all of them. See you next time",
      "I had an experiential evening with my family, everything surprised me by the food cooked with fresh ingredients, the wine that warmed me up with the chilly weather in Da Lat. Staff was very kind and she was very serious in asking if I had any ingredient allergies. I will be back again, must try!"

      "The rice noodles are soft, the beef fresh and tender, cooked to perfection. Combined with crisp bean sprouts and scallions, every bite feels like harmony in a bowl. The highlight? Their sweet-and-sour dipping sauce that elevates the flavors of the beef to a whole new level. The cozy atmosphere, paired with the friendly smile of the owner, makes you feel right at home. This is more than just a meal—it’s a taste of Da Lat’s heartfelt hospitality. Phở Ân offers not only a delicious bowl of pho but also a sense of peace and warmth unique to this mountain town.

The seasoning is still the same, still rich and flavorful, with the fragrant scent of green onions, the sweet taste of long-simmered bones, plenty of meat, and delicious beef meatballs. The beef here is very good and fresh because the owners go to the market very early, selecting the freshest and most delicious cuts of meat. 40,000 dong for an adult-sized breakfast bowl is very cheap. Good value for money. The service is very good, and the owners are very friendly.",
      "This is one of the best Pho I ever had in Dalat so far. I like to broth taste very much here, the seasoning is light, delicacy. Besides, the cleanliness and well-preparation of ingredients from Beef, fresh herbs, to some garlic pickles is incredible. The decoration is eye-catching, tables and chairs are comfortable too. One small detail which also makes me like about this place is its floor kept clean without many trash on it after a bunch of customers. Highly recommend for your breakfast in Dalat, warm up your body in the cold weather!"

Granola fruit & yoghurt was delicious & a great portion. My friend had the egg/avo special & said it was absolutely amazing (I had food envy, I must admit) Cinnamon swirls are an absolute must try! Fresh out the oven. Second visit was for lunch, soup & sandwich was nice. Carrot cake was sublime, moist & perfect ratio of cake to frosting. Whilst we were there on our second visit, a disgruntled man entered the cafe & was rude to the manager about a previous incident where he had been asked to leave. The manager was extremely professional & calm despite the man getting progressively more aggressive. He handled the situation extremely well with minimal disruption to customers. The place is a credit to him.",
      "Absolutely perfect breakfast here at One More Cafe. went with 4 friends and everyone had a very delicious breakfast. The Eggs Benedict was the best I have ever had. On a nice thick toast with a real and thick slice of ham... not the processed kind. delicious hollandaise, cherry tomatoes and some green leaf herb that was uncommon but very tasty 120k and 10k for some crispy bacon on the side. 2 friends had the big breakfast at 125k but they also have a smaller serve at 70k. they have healthy options. Buddha Bowl, and salads and soups... nice decor and background music. lovely staff. will go back again tomorrow opens 8am",

      "Our maki, sashimi, and tempura exceeded all expectations! The products are extremely fresh and seem to be cooked so right! It’s all very japanese, from the way you order meals to the attitude of waiters. We expected to have a nice dinner, but what we’ve got was an absolutely wonderful one! We paid about $25 for our substantial meals and it seemed a great value for money.",
      "Sushi bars always lure me in, even if I'm in Vietnam and absolutely loving the phenomenal local cuisine. Today I wanted sushi and decided to give Fujiya a chance. I have to say I was entirely blown away by how authentic this meal turned out to be. In fact, several of the dishes were prepared better than those I've sampled in Japan. We started with chawanmushi and it was divine; slivers of enoki mushrooms nestled over the delicate egg custard, which was cooked to a perfect texture. I opted for a bento box to get some variety and what followed was shockingly delicious. A sampling of sushi and sashimi came first; generous slabs of fresh fish including salmon, tuna, mackerel and octopus. Then came chicken teriyaki, which was tender and juicy, and without the sticky, overly sweet sauce that usually is served. The meat had clearly been marinated and was rich with flavor, so no need for sugary sauce. Then came a filet of seasoned mackerel, grilled by a chef who has some real skills. The meal also included some sides that I'm especially picky about; miso soup and kimchi. The soup was among the best I've ever had, served hot in a covered bowl, with some enoki, seaweed and soft tofu. The kimchi was crunchy and bright, with just the right level of heat. Truly a perfect lunch, and priced at 250K. Wow. But the most impressive dishes were actually served to my partner and deserve special mention. We love oysters, and decided to try what Fujiya had on the menu. The platter that arrived was probably the most beautiful dish I've ever seen. Two giant oysters sat snugly on crushed ice, topped with a raw quail egg yolk, various caviar and a sprig of sea grapes. Colorful flowers and garnishes were artistically placed, and we both grabbed our phones to take pictures. The oysters turned out to be directly imported from Hiroshima, a city known to have some of the best oysters in Japan, and these were a revelation of texture and flavor and we immediately ordered two more. Honestly I can't think of an oyster I loved more than this one. She also ordered a salmon gunkan trio and again, the presentation left me in awe. A beautiful piece of salmon was wrapped around the rice instead of seaweed, and ikura plus other caviar were featured in the center. Amazingly creative. Service was friendly and well-paced, and we were hardly rushed. The seating was in a private wooden enclosure like you would find in Japan and was quite comfortable, the perfect spot to celebrate our last day in Vietnam. The whole three-story restaurant is quite beautiful, well-designed and exceptionally clean. Kane, a manager, politely helped serve our dishes and added a personal touch to what was really one of the more elegant meals we've had anywhere. I remain grateful to everyone at Fujiya for their dedication to the craft.",
      "My husband and I had such a great experience eating here, we ordered one sake ikura roll (there was a lot of salmon in it), ramen with pork and kimchi udon soup. Waiter gave us potato salad as a compliment and it was very tasty. Everything was great, very delicious and portions are really big. And there were Japanese people eating next to us, it says a lot about the quality of food here."

      "If I could give this place more stars I would! Very friendly staff and the best food I’ve had so far in my 3 weeks in Vietnam! Everything tasted very fresh, the restaurant was flexible with dietary requirements as we are travelling with a vegetarian. We had a few tastes of different dishes and got to try the artichoke tea (definitely give it a go it’s delicious). It’s recommended by lonely planet and by us :) will be back if we’re ever in Da Lat again!"

Me and my gf were having a great hanging out seating outside, looking out to some glowing lights of the (kind of) greenhouse valley, with some tasty hot teas and cakes. Prices are very fair too (~40k - 65k).",
      "I recently visited Túi Mơ To Café, and it was a delightful experience! The café has a unique, cozy ambiance with lots of natural light and a peaceful atmosphere, perfect for unwinding. I had their signature coffee, which was smooth and well-balanced, paired with a delicious homemade pastry. The staff were friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home. It’s a great spot to relax, enjoy great coffee, and take in the charming surroundings. Highly recommend it if you're in the area!",
      "The staff welcomed me and enthusiastically guided me from the moment I entered the gate. The order and service staff were extremely enthusiastic and guided me down to where to take photos with nice deco and which tables had nice views. Because the first time I came, I was a bit confused because the restaurant was large and had many views. I think they're just dedicated but still very fun and not awkward like other shops I've been to. I go to Da Lat 4-5 times a year, but this is the first time I'm writing a review because the staff is so enthusiastic ❤️ Seeing the package of medicine my lover brought, my friends told each other to bring an ashtray, that's sophistication."

      "I was escaping Hanoi's suffocating heat and chose Dalát since I had already visited Sapa. Both at 1500m above sea level, offer a nice respite from the sweltering valley temperatures. I was looking for an apartment and saw Dalát Train Villa and Cafe on a Dalát Expat FB page. I took a Grab motorcycle taxi and went to check it out. The Administrator, a lovely woman Nguyen Thuy, showed me the premises. The first studio apartment was a bit small, but the second was perfect The property is a very large, elaborate garden, with 8 villas built in French Colonial style, circa 1935. They vary in size and apartments, from rooms, to small studios and family cottages that can accommodate a whole family, with small to full kitchen facilities. There is a community laundry room and the family apartments have their own washing machine. There is an old refurbished train car converted into a Cafe, with additional outdoors seating. They are open from 8:00am to 9:30 pm, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, beverages, cocktails and snacks. The food is fresh made, eclectic and wonderful.The staff is friendly and eager to help. They will bring food to your room on rquest. The apartments are serviced once a week. Prices are competitive, with discounts on long- term stays and 15% off Cafe consumption for lodgers.Thuy and her husband Curtis are great regarding suggestions, recommendations and overall assistance. Their two children are delightful and puppies Mimi and Brownie are friendly and playful. I have been here two weeks and not going anywhere for a while. Lots to see in the area and excellent location, very walkable. I do not hesitate to recommend.",
      "I came on a quiet Sunday morning and soaked up the nice atmosphere and train theme over a wonderful healthy breakfast of fresh fruit and yogurt. Tasty cup of strong coffee to accompany and provide the instant wake-up needed for a lazy Sunday. Curious to try a lunch or dinner-I\"ll be back. Met and had a nice exchange with the proprietor who treated me to a second cup. No siesta today!",
      "We visited the cafe after looking around the Dalat train station. The cafe was roughly a 10 minute walk away. The location was fab. There is an open garden area with a number of tables and chairs and some seating within an old carriage. Our children loved the freedom of the gardens to run around. The menu was ample and food ordered was delicious- especially the Vegetable lasagne. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting some delicious food in a quaint spot."

      "Food was great (we had loaded fries, burrito with garlic chips and bangers and mash which were Cumberland so I was over the mood) and staff were very attentive. Owner was a lovely guy too but didn’t catch his name. The bar sports a large screen playing ESPN and also sells Saigon cider which was a treat. Well worth the trip if you’re in De Lat!",
      "This isn't just the best sports bar in da lat .. the food is 10/10 .. the waggu burger is delightful and would recommend to anyone .. they also have a wide selection of food and beers .. the owner is very welcoming and makes you feel right at home even though you could be miles from it !! Thanks and keep up the good work !!",
      "I visited a small burger shop then wandered a couple of doors up the street and spotted the Down Under Bar Sports Bar. It turns out that the owner, Peter, was the former proprietor of the burger place! He was there during my visit and we chatted away for a couple of hours as he told me how it all came to be. He is a good man with doing something a little different to the norm. TV screens adorn the walls playing various sporting events from surfing, to football, golf, cricket, both rugby codes and even AFL. To name but several. It opens early enough (and stays open late enough) for you to be able to catch your sport of choice from anywhere in the world. As a smoker, I didn't find the non-smoking policy to be a hinderance, as it is easy enough to step outside to partake if you so choose. The drinks menu was extensive, from local and imported craft beers (and all your favourites), to mixed drinks and cocktails. The \"grub\" (food) menu was exceptional with some hilariously named dishes (Peter has quite the sense of humour), from simple snacks up to fine quality steaks. All of which - like the drinks - are within the budget of even the most budget conscious visitor. Particularly at Happy Hour, where drinks were 50% off! The decor is clean and fresh and the staff most friendly. All bearing testament to the vision Peter and his wife have for the place. It had only been open a couple of months prior to my visit and I encourage you to stop in and say g'day to Peter and enjoy the ambience. In my conservative estimation, I rate it a solid 11/10. Do not visit Da Lat without dropping in. Stu."

Service was amazing. The young man extremely polite and helpful. Even took some pictures and air dropped them for us. Overall wonderful end to our last night in Da Lat.",
      "What a gorgeous find! After reading reviews, I was delighted to stumble upon this bar. Beautifully decorated for Christmas, it offered a warm welcome. Once inside, I was surprised by the small size, but the design was such that you didn't feel crowded. Welcomed by the charming and personable Nguyen, I chose a glass of the Viognier and generous plate of prosciutto. The experience was delightful. I will be back to try the Italian white. Highly recommended.",
      "We popped in to have a quick drink with our three boys and ended up coming back every night we were in Da Lat. The children loved the space, the lovely lady Tran was excellent with the three boys helping them make wax seals and chatting with them. The wine was delicious as well! A real gem."

      "Table not to be missed. Fusion cuisine, Italian inspired. The sauces each have their own particularity, but always a flavor in harmony with the meat; chosen. I recommend the smoked basa fish and the porcheta. A variety of wines, white and red, are offered and sound advice is provided. The dishes are plentiful, and the service very attentive. The restaurant offers space and conviviality; the decoration is elegant. The staff is particularly welcoming and available. We celebrated New Year's Eve there, with family, with great pleasure.",
      "This restaurant is a kind of hidden and chill, the decor is just my style. With only 2 people going, I couldn't order many dishes, because each portion was quite large. I ordered salad and steak, Salad is a no-brainer because Da Lat vegetables are always fresh and delicious, the steak is also very delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.",
      "We weren't sure how the food would turn out after reading some reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised with everything we ordered. The steak was cooked to our requests and was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be back for that. The octopus was also was good. At first i thought the portion might not be enough but it was, in fact, very filling, but also left us with a bit of room for dessert. They only have 1 option right now,a pumpkin budin which was nice. I'd also like to note that the staff was very attentive. They wrote down our order and confirmed it, which i appreciated, and they also answered any of our questions regarding ingredients and allergies/sensitivities. You could tell that they were really making an effort to serve with care. Clean well stocked bathrooms as well were a big plus. Definitely recommend coming here for a treat dinner, as it is pricer than other traditional options, however it was totally worth it!"

      "Food in Indonesia. When having trouble choosing a menu in Hanoi, for a few days in the city, always eat western fast food. Iseng Iseng googling Halal Food in Indonesian version, it turns out there is Resto and Cafe Batavia - Taste of Indonesia Hanoi. Finally can Eat Enak, Goat Tongseng, Chicken Preset, Dendeng Balado and Grain Asem, not forgetting Mendoan tempe and corn bakwan. The story of revenge along with other Indonesian comrades. Good Job Batavia, Great Food",
      "The food here is incredible, authentic Indonesian food. I've both eaten here and also ordered home. Its a hidden gem. The prices are very reasonable and the staff are very friendly. Will definitely be going back. Definitely check out this spot because its very different when compared to the other available cuisines in Hanoi.",
      "We tried the Ayam Penyet. Of course not as spicy as back in Malaysia or Indonesia but decent enough to allay my craving. The interior is cozy and spacious. We liked the place. Price range from 300-400k dong for 2 people."

      "Exceptional food in an stylish setting. The restaurant is just off a busy street and is set among some local eateries but don't let the location fool you, this is an establishment of the highest quality. You go into the waiting area which is overlooks the open kitchen, you immediately see the care and passion of the chef's. The attention to detail I have only seen in some of the best restaurants. This was a tasting menu paired with no alcoholic or alcoholic (+ cost), we tried both. This was the only minor gripe that some of the pairings did not go so well, weren't bad but this could have been due to availability in the local market. The food was exceptional, the items I was unsure of were outstanding, highlights, the cone!!!, fois gras and buffalo and the kumquat (what a dish). Everything flowed possibly a little quick could of had a couple more minutes between dishes to read the postcards about the next course but nothing off putting and the staff were outstanding and had great understanding of the food. Highly recommend as a treat",
      "Chapter was truly one of our most memorable dining experiences to date. We had the 10 course tasting menu which was delicious, creative, and made from locally sourced ingredients. The chef’s passion for Vietnamese history, food and culture is reflected in each dish. We also had the pleasure of speaking to the chef about his inspiration for the various dishes, which was an informative and insightful experience in itself. The restaurant made last minute accommodations for our special dietary requirements and the service was truly exceptional. The wine pairings with the tasting menu were sublime! We would highly recommend this gem in Hanoi for a truly unique Vietnamese fine dining experience.",
      "I have been to many fine dining restaurants in vietnam and all were amazing but at the end of the day it's just a dinner, at chapter it felt like more then a dinner the chef brought us on a journey of local produce and fantastic taste. With the new campfire menu we tried, it really felt like eating at a fine dining camp site. The non-alchaholic pairing was a pleasant surprise that I honestly didn't expect. It was vietnamese tastes and ideas at its core but presented in a fashion that turns every dish into a painting. The staff were incredible and extremely attentive and never missed anything, described each dish to its core, and were fun and bubbly to talk to. Would recommend and will be going back when the menu changes."

But the price is not very expensive, of course compared to the local water prices, the rice is expensive, but it is very valuable for clean food, one by one fresh ingredients.

Especially salad and mango salad should be roasted.",

      "During our 2017 visit to Hanoi, my partner and I lucked into finding the Red Bean. We loved it and i wrote a Trip Advisor review at the time. Fast forward to 2025 ... back in Hanoi and wanted to again try the Red Bean. We needed a bit of refined dining after the chaos and noise of the city. There were 7 of us and the restaurant was about a 1/2 walk from our hotel. We passed a number of restaurants along the way and some members of the group suggested just stopping at one of them instead of trekking so far. My partner and I were pretty set on the Red Bean though and our friends stuck with us. We we just hoping we hadn't oversold it. And we hadn't! It was every bit as wonderful as the first time. It is elegant - white table clothes, lovely serving dishes, etc. but no need to dress fancy. We were all in pretty casual clothes. Food was AMAZING (upscale Vietnamese) service IMPECCABLE, and SO REASONBLE. To give you an idea of the price, we shared the tasting menu (many dishes and all delicious) and shared a few bottles of wine and the bill for each of us was around $55 Canadian. Everyone agreed that the trek was well worth it. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a delicious meal here. Lots of choice, Vietnamese food but also European food. It is more expensive compared to other restaurants here, but you get what you pay for. The food tasted delicious and the service is very nice and really ready to help you. Definitely recommended if you are in Hanoi and want to eat delicious food",
      "Ly Nguyen was our server and she was fantastic! Food was amazing and presentation was beautiful. We got a 5 course meal of authentic Vietnamese food for the equivalent of 25 USD. Ly was VERY helpful in answering questions, educating us on the food and providing other recommendations for Hanoi. She went above and beyond. Service in general from all staff was excellent. Would DEFINITELY come back here."

We appreciate that we can be certain the food here is completely vegan as many other places who claim to be vegan also serve egg or milk products and you need to ask to make sure. We had the Saigon bowl and the vegan chickpea tuna sandwich, which we really enjoyed. The blueberry muffin smoothie is my favourite drink and I’ve ordered it just about every time. Pricing is a little higher than other vegan places, but the quality of food (as well as the aesthetics), the service, and the atmosphere are fantastic. A few steps up, there is a completely air conditioned floor, which we always choose as a break from the Hanoi summer heat while we eat. Today, when we came up, a gentleman working here turned on additional fans and checked on us to make sure we were comfortable. We thought that was so kind.

      "I stumbled upon this lovely vegan food spot in Hanoi. Despite being in a central area, it’s so quiet and peaceful inside. The menu is extensive with lots of choice. There’s so much fresh food to try from and lots of different protein options. I enjoyed my Tempeh Bagel so much that I came back the next day for another one and also had a fresh orange juice and blueberry smoothie. I’d definitely recommend and come back again. The food and drinks are inexpensive considering the quality. Nice option if you’re looking to get away from the street food within the old quarter.",
      "I was there for breakfast and was very happy about the vegan cafe in Hanoi! A very delicious bagel, totally delicious juice and good coffee, as well as free, treated water - a great breakfast! A must for all blant-based fans:)"

Prices in line with the market of ha noi, 5 people the expense is about 14 euros each, with 2 beers and appetizer and a plate served",

      "We asked our hotel To make a reservation here for us because our tour guide had recommended. We were not disappointed, we didn’t opt for the set menu as there seemed a lot of food and we had to order 1 set menu per person . We shared a Papaya beef salad to share between us then I had chicken fried rice and my husband had stir fried beef in peanut sauce served with rice . We then shared flambé banana and ice cream ( a dessert a rare treat in Vietnam ) The service was excellent- very friendly owners , who mentioned post Covid that they had had to relocate from a good position by the lake to a few streets back and they were nit as busy because if the location until People find them again . They have I my been reopened a few months . Highly recommend as an alternative to all the street food surrounding"

We ordered avocado and mango rolls, pad thai, tofu with tomato and some crispy tofu balls with a very rich cream cheese.

It is vegetarian; I am not a vegetarian but I was able to find some tasty dishes to try and found them very good, beautifully presented and good value.

      "This restaurant was perfect, the interior was beautiful but the food was incredible. I had the Vietnamese pancake and the lovely staff showed me how to put it together and eat it and it was genuinely the best food I’ve had in Vietnam. My friend also had the pork bun cha and she similarly loved it. The prices were good for the amount and quality of the food you get (90,000 dong for mine) however they do add 10% tax but she was nice enough to take this off as we prearranged prior to choosing the place.",
      "We have been on holiday in Vietnam now for 2 weeks and we have finally found our absolute favorite Vietnamese restaurant!! All our dishes were amazing but in particular we really enjoyed the skewers. The waitress showed us how to assemble the options arranged on the plate into a rice paper wrapper and then roll up and dip into the dipping sauces (which I also have to specially mention were soooooo good!). There were lemon grass chicken skewers, rice noodles, pineapple, cucumber, carrot, mint and lettuce to roll up inside. I will remember it forever!",
      "We visited this restaurant on no less than three occasions during our stay in Hanoi . The food was excellent and the atmosphere, warm and friendly . The Bun Cha was totally delicious. The staff team members under the guidance of Tuyet were keen to speak English and make the eating experience fun . Thank you"

      "Popped in here during Tet as it was open and we had been meaning to go for a while. The inside is very well decorated and has a cool vibe to it. Not sure if it was due to Tet that they seemed light on staff, when we went in we didn't see a member of staff for the first 10mins, but we were happy enough to find a table and grab a menu to browse through. We both really enjoyed the chicken shawarma wraps, the had great flavour and were well filled. The side pitta bread and hummus was tasty, we were not too keen on the falafels though, they were a little on the dry side. They were out of vine leaves, so we will just have to go back and try them another time The member of staff we had was a little cold and didn't make much effort to interact, but otherwise the food was tasty and good value so we enjoyed that",
      "This spot offers one of the most delicious meals in Hanoi. I ordered Beef Shawarma Fattah, Fries and Yoghurt Cucumber Salad that goes great with rice that is in Fattah. The price of what i ordered 8.5$.",
      "Al Sultan serves some of the best Egyptian food we've ever had, and we lived in the Middle East and visited Egypt. We're willing to bet this is the best Egyptian food in Vietnam. If you know Egyptian and Middle Eastern food, just choose your favorites and enjoy. We like the koshari, falafel, and shawarma. What's even more fun about Al Sultan is all the football, Mo Salah, and ancient Egypt swag. Good times!"

      "If you are looking for true authentic Indian food in Vietnam, a country where getting good Indian food is a challenge, then Masala Art, Hanoi is the answer. We were a group of 6 friends from New Delhi, India, came to Vietnam for holidays for 10 days with Hanoi as our last destination. After having Vietnamese food for 8 days, decided to try Indian food at Masala Art. Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Our experience was so good that we repeated our visit for Dinner next day too. Each dish was excellently well prepared, delicious and flavourful. We had mix of Vegetarian and Non Veg dishes. Each was truly delicious. In sweets, we tried Gajar Ka Halwa; OMG, really mouth watering and authentic Red Carrot Halwa. Service and hospitality was superb; very attentive, highly personalized; always smiling. Please reserve a table when you plan to visit and enjoy the lunch / dinner at Masala Art. This place is fairly occupied and busy.",
      "Ok, I was a little nervous based on the reviews which seemed overly positive but I am very pleasantly surprised. I decided to give this place a try since my previous preferred Indian restaurant has recently changed ownership after 15 years. This was a 3 person business dinner. We spend roughly a but under $100 for a table packed full of food. A few apps, the meat kebab platter, several mains, a biryani, and two types of naan. I would say all the dishes except for one were good to excellent. The one dish that was disappointing was the palak paneer which was still ok but it was incredibly bland. I like palak paneer so I was not expecting it to be some huge flavor explosion because it's a simple white cheese with creamed spinach but I expect it to have some flavor and good palak paneer usually has a creamy but subtle richness to it. This palak paneer was flavorless. The manchurian cauliflower app was not what I would consider an Indian dish but it was really good. The rest of the dishes were yummy and more traditional (not that I would know) compared to what I have had at other Indian places. I will happily return there in the future. Service was fast and attentive.",
      "Masala Art in Hanoi offers a delightful dining experience with its elegant and ambient atmosphere, featuring a regal Rajasthan-style interior that exudes luxury. The food is delicious, and the staff is friendly and attentive, making you feel right at home. Located in a convenient spot, it's the perfect place to relax and enjoy authentic flavors while on holiday. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a blend of comfort and sophistication."

      "Visited 3Spoons for a weekday family lunch. Beautiful Restaurant with a spectacular panoramic views of Hanoi. The restaurant offers both an a la carte menu, as well as a buffet for lunch. We opted for the buffet as there is such a substantial offering, ranging from Italian dishes, local Vietnamese and an amazing array of sushi, and not to forget the delectable dessert room!!! Needless to say we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal, and finished off with some of the best coffee we've experienced in Vietnam. A very special mention to the wonderful service from all the staff, especially the professional Ms. Huong who took our reservation and explained the menu to us, and our waitress Ms. Thuy Duong who made sure we never had an empty glass, and provided friendly and efficient service to us. 5 star food, 5 star service, 5 star location!",
      "My wife and I very much enjoyed our meal. The restaurant manager could not have been more polite. The customer service was outstanding from start to finish. Most importantly, the food was delicious as always.. 😋 The Intercontinental brand never fails to impress me... We have eaten in Intercontinental hotels in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang as well... Wow! Three Spoons is very highly recommended, along with all of the other Intercontinental hotel restaurants!!"

      "After receiving a recommendation from a local tour guide, I visited on the evening of the last day of the trip. I actually liked the unique atmosphere of a local restaurant where English was not widely spoken. Even though I only said a simple greeting, I felt like everyone was looking at me favorably, so I felt relieved. The rice noodles came out just a minute after ordering, and the soup was thick. The fried food that my grandfather sold separately only cost 10,000 dong, and it was eaten dipped in soup. I think it is a restaurant with the right level of difficulty that allows you to feel the atmosphere and taste of a local restaurant, but is not too hard.",
      "The restaurant serves only one type of pho, beef pho, which features a thick broth and plenty of green onions. It is made by slowly simmering beef bones and is characterized by its deep richness and flavor. The noodles are soft and topped with plenty of green onions and herbs, which blend perfectly with the broth. On the table are condiments such as lime, garlic vinegar, and homemade chili sauce, allowing customers to change the flavor to their liking. The prices are quite reasonable, and those who want to enjoy the Vietnamese specialty pho in Hanoi should try it at this restaurant!",
      "If you are a Pho lover, then you absolutely must check out this Pho restaurant. This is highly recommended by my Airbnb host, as well as other local foodie experts. It's a good sign when you see locals only. The place, a hole in the wall or actually in an alley with two long tables, shared table. This place only offers Beef Pho and does it very well! This is the original Pho Thin, the first location. A hole is the wall, situated on an alley. From the moment you walk in, you can smell the aroma of the rich broth and beef permeating the air. The clear broth looks simple however it packs a beefy and flavorful with a perfect balance of spices and seasoning that creates an authentic, one-of-a-kind taste. The beef is tender and generous portion. The noodles are perfectly cooked. Topped with a generous amount of green onions. Make sure to pair it with the Fried donuts and tea from the older man next door and must be paid separately. They have condiments available at the table to customize your taste. The garlic vinegar is great, chili oil paste, sliced chili, and lime. The service is fast, despite the language barrier. Just point out what you want. It's an outdoor dining, on an alley. No AC, just fans. Overall, this Pho restaurant is a must-visit for any food lover."

      "This is a great place for dinner, service was outstanding the beer was superbly cold with a great variety of local beers. The food was delicious and our waiter Harry along with his colleague walked us back to our accommodation with umbrellas as it was raining heavily. Admittedly it was only a short distance but that is what i call fantastic service. We will be back for another meal tonight",
      "We went to the restaurant as it was recommended by our tour guide. We went here early evening without booking and we were lucky to get a table as many tour guides use this as a restaurant serving a set menu for their tour groups. The restaurant is situated near the Old Quarter and serves traditional Vietnamese dishes. We found the food was excellent and service very good. I strongly recommend this restaurant but advise booking as it is used by tour groups.",
      "You can get a good meal here. The dessert (flambe banana crepe with slivered coconut, vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup) was delicious. The birthday cake they served was good. There are framed traditional musical instruments mounted on the wall as decoration."

If I wasn’t leaving the city, I’d most definitely be back. 😋",
      "The restaurant is located inside the hotel, and provides 10% off for guests staying at the hotel. It serves Japanese style hot pot with Wagyu beef. The quality of the beef tasted like Angus but I guess any beef that comes from Japan could be called Wagyu? No idea. It just tasted very rough and not like a regular Wagyu eaten in Japan. It was a slow night at the restaurant and there were only 4 tables including us. The environment was nice, veggies were all-you-can-eat free refill, and we generally had a nice time. The service was pretty great, and our server, Huyen, has been helpful and nice!",

      "Great spot to sit - eat, drink and watch people pass below. Annie was a pleasure to be served by - she was lovely, very polite and happy to help with directions and generally with our food, I hope to see Annie in Australia one day! We also had the pleasure of being joined by two kids; who were very well behaved and always left when you said ‘okay time for me to eat!’ Food was priced higher than most places, but worth it for the view and the experience from the staff. Thank you again Annie!",
      "The spot is nice for dinner. Unfortunately it rained, but the waiters quickly rearranged the parasols so we didn't get wet outside. You can order a variety of local vietnamese food that tastes good. We recommend the vegetarian spring rolls.",
      "I Would highly recommend this place for food and drinks, very chilled vibes and great staff, catered to all my needs and I was well looked after. The pho was top notch and great draft beer, perfect for solo travelers and couples, anyone who wants some great food and drinks with a nice view of the street below from the balcony. Please visit you will not be disappointed."

      "From the warm greeting at the door, to the polished but friendly service, May De Cuisine excels in all areas. The menu is a broad representation of northern Vietnamese cooking, with extensive a la carte and set menu meals, including vegetarian choices. Set on three or four floors of a quaint restored old building in the bustling Old Quarter, May De Cuisine is a quiet oasis of comfortable seating and large portions. The set menu of four courses ordered was almost too much for one meal, but we tried our best, as the food was prepared and presented with such care. In particular, the young server named Timber was charming and attentive without fail, with excellent English skills.",
      "Recently visited a restaurant and the experience was extremely positive. From the very first minutes, attention to detail was noticeable – the interior is cozy, with pleasant lighting and comfortable atmosphere. The staff is polite and friendly, the waiters (Timber) are excellent at navigating the menu and are always available to help with the selection.",
      "We were taken to this fine restaurant by or guide Sammy N. She ordered a variety of dishes to try and I wish I could tel you what they were in Vietnamese. We had a delicious smoked duck salad, fried crispy white fish, chicken and cashew stirfry, steamed vegetables, soup and a chocolate dessert. Great service and nice location."

      "At the end of the Ninh Ben tour, we were taken to a Bun Cha restaurant for free, but I had eaten there the day before and didn't really like it. When I told the guide, he took me to this restaurant because it is famous for its okowa. I arrived around 7pm, but it was very crowded and I finally managed to get a seat. To order, first you ask if you want your okowa plain or with corn, and if you want chicken, pork or beef as toppings. The local guide helped me with the order, such as whether I wanted it steamed or fried, which was helpful. I ordered a simple okowa with steamed chicken. It was refreshing and easy to eat even in the heat, and it was delicious. I added soy sauce halfway through and it changed the flavor and was delicious.",
      "Excellent!!! The place was crowded with Vietnamist people. They have rice with different toppings you can choose. Rice could be traditional sticky rice, turmeric sticky rice etc and toppings like chicken, beef, mushrooms etc The price was really cheap, we paid around 4-5€ for everything."

The beer on offer covers the north and south of Vietnam and there are a selection of craft beers available. The food was good and I would recommend it to any sports fan in the area. We also liked the football team pillows.",
      "This great sports bar went out of their way to make sure that I could watch a UK rugby match late in the Ha Noi night - despite my being the only person there who was interested in te game. I dropped in earlier in the day and made an enquiry. Half an hour later Ha Anh, the brilliant manager, dropped me a note to confirm that all systems were go (despite all sorts of technical difficulties). Sure enough, when I turned up all was ready: I saw the game (don't ask!) and enjoyed several pints of excellent witbier to accompany the action. Many, many thanks. This is a place worthy of recommendation."

The fantastic ambiance and friendly service make for a truly enjoyable dining experience.",
      "Overall, this place was very good. The staff was very accommodating even though our wait time for our pizza and seats was well over an hour each. They offered good service and provided our table with complementary dessert due to the issues that we unfortunately experienced; which is why I gave them 4stars. This type of customer service was excellent and is not very common. The pizza itself was good, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the very best in Hanoi, but it was good. Very crowded and busy, with a nice atmosphere, the prices are decent and you do get a good portion size. Follow @travelingypsey on Instagram & GoogleMaps!!! Pictured is the Mushroom Pizza!"

      "Small five stars. My boyfriend and I had three courses for lunch and drinks. Close to four stars, which is because the elements on the plate were anonymous, and without particularly interesting taste or texture. The rest was excellent though. The waiter recommended the Pho cocktail to me, which was the most interesting feature of the lunch, both in the way it was made and the way the drink tasted. Great decor and wonderful staff.",
      "Came here with my mom for a fine lunch. 1. Location: in the middle of Hanoi, luxury area but not too vibrant. Should come here on a sunny day to take marvellous photos on the street 2. Space: The restaurant has different areas to choose based on your interest, I chose a perfect table next to the window with an outstanding view to Sofitel Metropole Hotel across the road. Design is high-end but not overwhelmed, not too crowded. Such a perfect place for lowkey people like me. 3. Food: We got Temptation Set Menu with 3 courses, freshly start with smoked salmon salad & creamy cauliflower soup. Beef filet with red wine sauce was too good to be true. The most impressive thing was strawberry sorbet, fantastic ending. It’s was a pity that seafood quenelle failed though…the French oyster’s smell wasn’t processed well. 4. Suitable for: family, couples 5. Price: 690,000++vnd/ 3 courses (drinks excluded) Overall: definitely gonna come back to discover more",
      "The food was excellent and the service was very efficient and friendly. The whole evening was made perfect with a live piano performance during the evening. We ate 2 of the beef dishes and both were lovely and share a prawn dish to start which really was delightful"

      "We visited this restaurant because they sell mainly vermicelli noodles. The dish is called pho it was mentioned quite a lot before we came to Vietnam. Most people complimented this as a delicious dish that definitely we must try when we come here we ordered two bowls of beef pho, it was really good. But what I don't like is that the beef noodle soup has too many onions and the wait staff is also quite long so I don't like it very much.",
      "I quite like the food here, I find the broth of the dish very delicious and rich, the noodles are soft and the beef that is cooked with is also seasoned very well. You can also order more cakes to eat with vermicelli noodles, I see they also give me an extra portion of raw vegetables. The restaurant staff said that the Vietnamese way of eating is to mix raw vegetables and eat with vermicelli noodles. It really tastes so much better"

      "This spot is great , me and my girlfriend visited it last night for dinner and it was a great experience. I have been meaning to visit it for a while, as it's near my house. I always thought it didn't look busy from the outside but I realized yesterday it has a lovely downstairs part with outside seating area with a good vibe that you can't see when looking at the restaurant from street-level. It had a great little bar with a lot of variety which was nice and the food was delicious too. My favorite was the summer rolls with crab, I also loved the desserts too. We tried the pickleballs with ice cream and also the passion fruit créme brulée. Hope this place will get more business, it seems to have a lot of interesting items on the menu and the staff are so nice !"

      "Whenever I crave chicken rice, I have to drag my husband and children to Chicken Society. The restaurant is located on the premises of the Fraser suites hotel, so it's super nice. Sitting and eating overlooking the hotel's swimming pool is very chill. At noon, the green trees are cool to the eye, and in the evening, the lights turn on sparklingly. The restaurant has a separate play area for children, so the couple eats without having to look after their children, which my children really like. The chicken rice here is super delicious, the rice is soft, tender, and flavorful, and the chicken is soft and sweet. Sometimes ordering a few more dishes from the menu is also delicious. Enthusiastic and friendly staff, especially a friend named Ngan. In general, this is my favorite restaurant, I highly recommend everyone to come!!",
      "Food is reasonably priced, super cheap especially on holidays, the restaurant does not charge any extra fees. You can buy a swimming ticket, take a shower and then eat at the restaurant. Restaurant staff Friendly and enthusiastic. Thank you for your professionalism. Quan took care of my family for a thoughtful dinner. We will definitely come back"

The sky bar does not close until midnight but the food service stops like 5-6pm. It would be so nice if they serve some type of finger food or something. Other than that it is very nice!!",

      "Visiting Hanoi the first time The restaurant was highly recommended by friends and family We had our Christmas dinner here with 25 people and they were able to prepare for the big party without problems. Menu choice was either traditional Vietnamese or western. The fried spring rolls was one of the best I’ve ever had. The broth for the beef pho took over seven hours to prepared, and yes it is so tasty Price is very inexpensive Highly recommend this restaurant",
      "The moment I stepped in, I was so excited to see many bottles of wine but they serve only non-Vietnamese wine by​ glass​. I wanted to sip Vietnamese wine, it was a let down​ but they serve Not-typical-Vietnamese dishes. I like the way they serve dishes as it is more westernized. I found it sophisticated. ​It is Michelin Bib Gourmand. If you want to try Vietnamese cuisine with a unique taste, you can try Duong's. We had a set menu (8 dishes) Probably exclusive to group tourists ? It was fine but 2 ​of prawn​/shrimp dishes ​were included, which I found strange​. ​ ​Their service could be improved",
      "Upon our arrival in Hanoi, we were eagerly recommended this restaurant by both friends and family. The menu offered a delightful selection of both traditional Vietnamese dishes and Western options. Amongst our choices, the fried spring rolls stood out as one of the best we have ever tasted. The beef pho broth, meticulously prepared for over seven hours, was a testament to the restaurant's dedication to flavor and quality. To our surprise, the prices were incredibly affordable, making our dining experience even more enjoyable. Without hesitation, we wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking an exceptional culinary adventure in Hanoi."

      "This place has just opened up in Tay Ho. We walked past it a few times and having viewed the menu we decided to give it a go. I'm glad we did. While there are main courses, the specialty seems to be various types of meat on skewers. Between us we had lamb, beef, pork and veggies. The lamb was a little firm, but the beef was melt in your mouth tender. My wife loved the pork. Veggies were very nice as well. It really is a taste sensation. There are heaps of staff and they are super attentive without being annoying. Prices are a little on the higher side but it's definitely worth it. We will be back.",
      "This was my second visit to Barbak and the beautiful, impressive atmosphere makes it perfect for gatherings with friends. The space is calm and quiet, with sophisticated, stylish decor. Most importantly, the food is delicious. Both times, I was impressed by the beef tartare and various skewers, especially the wagyu tongue. I would recommend it to everyone.",
      "Stumbled across this walking down Hang Bo street. Incredible Mediterranean food - particularly the focaccia and dips. Apparently this restaurant only opened recently, but I suspect it will soon become a favourite for foodies visiting Hanoi. Great meat and vegetarian options, and a warm beautiful atmosphere."

      "Me and my friend visited here as one of the other 3 branches of this restaurant is in the village where she lives in England so we emailed to say we were coming and we were met with such warm welcome and service, Sachin was brilliant at helping with our order and the food came very quickly. The food itself was delicious and we didn’t have one bad mouthful. I couldn’t recommend this place more as even the price was good for the quality and quantity of food you get",
      "My wife an I often visited when it was Maazi; we live in Vinh Phuc Province and were unaware of the change until we got there. Not intending to discredit Maazi in any way, we were each happy with the subtle changes: The menu seems to offer more and the service was faster, so the food we ordered was still hot when it reached our table. I was looking for something different than my usual, so I asked Farhan for a suggestion; upon trying it, I was glad I sought his recommendation. Their black chai tea completed an awesome visit.",
      "After 6 weeks tasting all the delicious specialties of Vietnam, once we arrived in Hanoi, we wanted something else. What a nice surprise! The dishes were a real delight, we didn't leave a single crumb. Just a small downside about the slowness of the service to get our aperitif cocktails... which ultimately arrived at the same time as our dishes even though we had ordered them 15 minutes before. But the quality of the food made up for it."

      "Once in a lifetime opportunity to ever try snake cobra wine and meat! greeted by many friendly faces that welcomes you to his store. You will never find such a generous and kind owner like Mao even though there was a language barrier, he use translator to explain every dish to you to ensure you know what you are eating. Accompanied by his beautiful wife that cooks the dishes with so much passion that u can taste it in every bite of your dish. Truly a once in a lifetime unique experience",
      "Due to the time of day, I was the only customer. Made to feel extremely welcome. Dishes were explained, plentiful and tasty, cooked by the owner’s lovely wife. Tried the snake heart and blood, though was a bit over powered by the homemade wine. Also got to learn about the owner, Mao, and his family/restaurant history.",
      "Warm welcome, the owners are really very friendly and are very attentive. Snakes are presented to you alive, quickly killed, skinned in front of you and very quickly cooked. We were treated to 2 dishes (snake meat sautéed with garlic and spring rolls fried with snake meat). It's very good. The gentleman made us taste his snake wine (specialty of their home) a snake alcohol, lotus tea, dishes all unknown to us. In addition, we were treated to the Cobra qui dance demonstration! Really an address worth a visit! Thank you to them for this beautiful and rich experience!"

Located at the heart of the old quarter, is a must go place if you are craving for the home food. The agarbathi/ sambrani fragrance gives you a warm welcome feels u are back home. South Indian Thali, Chicken 65 and their Biriyani the best in Vietnam .. We had almost all the meals here during our entire stay in Vietnam. Higly recommended.. Don't Miss it",
      "Annam Restaurant in Hanoi offers a delightful South Indian dining experience right in the heart of the city, close to the Old Quarter. Situated on the 4th floor, accessible by lift, this cozy spot serves up a hearty, authentic South Indian meal. We had a full spread, including crispy idlis, dosa, and a rich ghee roast that truly hit the spot. The food is flavorful, well-prepared, and a welcome change for anyone craving Indian cuisine in Hanoi. The owner, who speaks Hindi, adds a personal touch to the experience, making it feel even more homely. The ambiance is simple yet comfortable, perfect for a casual meal. If you're in the area and looking for a taste of South India, Annam is definitely worth a visit!",
      "If you're craving for a South Indian vegetarian respite after touring Vietnam this place is it. The dosas and paneer kottu rotti are out of this world - highly recommend the Mysore Masala Dosa if you like a bit of spice. Staff seem to prioritise regulars over visitors, should improve with the right direction at the start of service."

      "This place is SO good that we came back twice in a weekend! The food is just fantastic! Completely authentic italian - I wish we lived here! It's a funny venue - set in a gorgeous old house but feels a bit odd as it's an italian trade place - showcasing Vespas (and a divine Motoguzzi!). Very popular with ex pat families at the weekend, it's just incredible value and the best pizzas we have had outside Italy. And the gelato.......",
      "Restaurant across from our hotel. We kept being drawn back to their food and gelato. We ate here at least 3x because of their perfect style Napoli pizza and daily made gelato. The salads are big so plan on splitting, the wine is good and reasonable so multiple glasses will happen. Their pastas are also very good and prices are mind blowing reasonable. It's casual outdoor, friendly service and laid back atmosphere will make you linger. It's a place that locals meet and catch up in the afternoons, but it was never overly busy when we went."

The prices are good, the staff are enthusiastic, although there are some dishes that take a long time to prepare, there are also dishes that are quick to make like the sauteed pork rind with pickles below..

The pork nachos were delicious and rather a huge portion which me and my husband shared and we loved constructing a burrito from all the flavours on the menu. Friendly staff with good English speaking and a nice clean restaurant with very good food",

The Taco's are of a medium to smallish size so if you're particularly hungry I would advise to order more.

The restaurant perfectly showcases the rich and vibrant flavors of Vietnamese cuisine in a modern yet cozy setting. The menu offers a diverse selection of traditional dishes, each prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients. I tried the [specific dish you enjoyed, e.g., \"pho,\" \"spring rolls,\" or \"bun cha\"], and it was exceptional. The balance of flavors was spot-on, and the presentation reflected great attention to detail. The staff at Viet Kitchen were friendly and attentive, always ready to recommend dishes and ensure that everything was just right. The ambiance added to the overall experience – a wonderful mix of contemporary design and traditional Vietnamese charm.

      "Authentic Vietnamese restaurant with romantic atmosphere and gorgeous views of Hanoi city and Hoan Kiem Lake. The food was very upscale in presentation without losing its authentic taste, and carefully prepared with high-quality ingredients, fresh herbs and spices -- We highly recommend Hanoi Grilled Fish (Cha Ca La Vong) dish! Service was excellent and unpretentious -- Our host for the evening, Mr. Hao, was very charming and professional. He made sure the customers could experience the best Vietnamese hospitality and will always remember Viet Kitchen as one of the reasons to return to Hanoi.",
      "This restaurant is exceptional. All levels. Perfect location in the \"Old Center\", on the 8th floor of the Premier Hotel & Rooftop. A 2-minute walk from the busiest square of the city (and the lake). Restaurant recently opened. Very chic and intimate with lake view. Delicious food. I tried nems, “pho ga” (chicken pho) and “mango sticky rice”. I went to this restaurant two nights in a row (and I did the same thing again because it was so good). Big bravo to the chef. The service is excellent. Thank you to Howard who welcomed me in the best way and advised me on dishes, things to see and activities in Hanoi! In perfect English and with a smile! The restaurant is not reserved for hotel guests. It's open to everyone. And until late at night. I will return during my next stay in Hanoi. I highly recommend! The service is"

      "This remains a firm favourite for a relaxed cocktail in the evening. We love the cocktails, which are not the usual classics, so it's nice to try new ones, I enjoyed the cherry sour and jungle bird this time. There are snacks provided to graze on, and they are always tasty.",
      "5 star Roasted Chicken All i wanted was a good old hearty chicken and i got the juicest whole chicken for the year. Other food were tastefully presented and delicious, the clam chowder perhaps a touch too salty. Loved the ambience and the surroundings. If you will go hysteria from smoke, this place is unsuitable. It is a cigar bar and smoking is okay in parts of the interior. RT 13/1/23",
      "Popped in here for the first-time as a treat prior to going to opera house for a show. The bar is simply stunning and has a really cool vibe, hard to imagine that you are in the middle of the old quarter when in here. We had 2 cocktails each which were delicious, my only slight critism would be that the waitress said we could order any of the drinks on the front page and get another free as it was happy hour but dis not make it clear that these had to be the same drink, hence why we ended up with four drinks which was rather pricey!"

      "It's a lovely place. It is food of Vietnamese ethnic groups in the north of the country. Local crowd. Different food. From insects to elaborate dishes of traditional cuisine. All exquisite. At an average of 10 euros a plate."

      "If you're after a change from rice and noodles try this place! We did and went back and back. On our first visit we tried the chicken wrap and the quesedilla. The wrap was the hands down winner. It comes with very thin french fries which were served hot. The only disappointments were that the drink prices were considerably higher than other dining places nearby and the menu prices having a 10% tax added at bill paying time. It would be much clearer if the menu had the actual price to be paid so there is no bad taste at the end of the visit. The staff were friendly and helpful. The dining area and toilet are clean. When we were flying home the staff were happy to put our meals in take away boxes and still tasted great at the airport.",
      "We came here after reading the trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed. We both had Mexican food as we fancied something different from Vietnamese food. It made a pleasant change. It’s a very basic fast food restaurant but the food was freshly made to order at a good price. They also sell a good selection of soft and alcoholic drinks like beers and wines. They also serve a selection of Vietnamese food should you want that. We are planning to go again before we leave Hanoi."

      "It’s rare to find eateries with great food in high volume areas that still value meeting customers and going above and beyond with service. Viet Spring Rolls definitely went above and beyond. The spring rolls were super fresh and flavorful but the main takeaway was how nice Pumpkin (I butchered the pronunciation of her real name so she opted for a nickname) and Thuỷ were. They taught us how to say ‘cheers’ in Vietnamese, corrected our pronunciation of some key words, wrote down suggestions for exploring Hanoi and overall were super cool. Thank you for a great experience!",
      "We have tried many different restaurants for spring rolls but so far we enjoy the ones from here the most. Tender and juicy meat wrapped inside the crunchy skin accompanied with great dipping sauce. They have fast and friendly service. Will definitely come back!",
      "For sure we won't forget about Viet Rolls, and specially Daisy, so gentle and nice and all the staff. The food was delicious, definitely one of the best spring rolls we had in Vietnam, and we were even offered happy water (meaning rice wine) and taught how to make a toast in vietnamise. Daisy was very talkative and made our dinner so much special. Definitely a place to go, if you are in Hanoi."

      "I love The Veg. Not only did I frequent this restaurant EVERY SINGLE DAY I was in Hanoi, but it essentially prevented my starvation too. After all, veganism is not an easy feat in this city. It is so cost-effective, the staff are absolutely lovely, and the food is extremely filling. Please get the vegan meatballs with black rice (you won't regret it). I will probably never go back to Hanoi, but if you do you best believe I'll be going back to The Veg for every meal if I do.",
      "Visited the cafe for brunch/lunch with my friend on our trip to Hanoi. Food was delicious - we tried the banana pancakes, vegan oatmeal, Hanoi rolls and stuffed tofu. Portions were extremely generous and we struggled to finish (but did so because it was so yummy!) Couldn’t fault the service, speed, menu or anything else. Love that they had clearly marked out “not spicy” on some options too! Juices were delicious also.",
      "😊 I was surprised when I was back this time. The restaurant has a new menu with more food options- adding more Western vegan food. 😗 If you eat there at night on weekends, you'll have free live music from other pubs nearby. On weekdays, it's quite peaceful. The price now is up though the food portion is still same. Like last time the Vietnamese noodles would be 50 or 55k, but now it's 65k. 🙂 The drink menu seems better and very friendly healthy drinks. 🤦‍♀️ It's still an inconvenience when the staff is only on 1st and 3rd floor whereas the customers on the 2nd floor want to ask for something like sauce, new order. They should have a bell or something which can help customers communicate with the staff without leaving the table. Yeah, I'm in the middle of my meal,I don't wanna leave my table just to call you, I pay for the service so you should present when we need. .. In sum, I dont think I will come back for a fourth visit or introduce this restaurant to my friends when I have no choice."

    "description": "San Fu Lou_ The house of three blessings. At our restaurant, we provide great tasty food, healthy cooking techniques and hygiene. At SFL, we take the traditional concept of a Chinese kitchen and bring it to a new level of sophistication with a contemporary Oriental ambience replete with the colours and material of a traditional Chinese \"house\". Our show kitchen, which is a first in Vietnam for a Chinese restaurant, allows diners to take in a visual feast before the food is served. This kitchen shows the guests the extensive Chinese influences which can be found in the Vietnamese culinary heritage today.These include the use of bean curd, stir-frying food, the use of chop-stick and wok, and so much more. SFL is a place to enjoy Chinese classics with handpicked teas and allows all guests to appreciate nostalgic tastes in these modern times.",

      "We saw this place and decided to dine here, the other restaurants were rather full and we hadn’t booked. Right, this restaurant is over 3 floors and the staff are really nice. We as always ordered too much or it could be that the Vietnamese restaurant are very generous. The food was ok, we had the bill and left the money, there was about an extra $3 or so, so we didn’t wait for the change. We left and the waitress ran after us with the change, she was surprised that we had left a tip.. Loved the hot and sour soup",
      "The restaurant is nicely located across from the park near the opera house. Theme street view and air- conditioning were wonderful. But we came for the food and it was tasty. The service met our every need.",
      "Friendly staff, Chinese space in Hanoi. If you want to enjoy Chinese cusine in Hanoi, let’s try San Fu lou. Highly recommend for you."
