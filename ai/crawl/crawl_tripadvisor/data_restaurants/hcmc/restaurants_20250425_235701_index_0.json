It is definitely one of the most cost-effective Vietnamese dishes for middle-class people traveling to hcmc!\n\nThe price is cost-effective. One dish is only 100-200k vnd. Two people ordered 4 dishes and each person was about 100 yuan. But the drinks are relatively expensive!\n\nSalad recommendation: Pomelo seafood salad. Very appetizing! The sour and spicy taste is suitable for Cantonese people!\nFried tofu. The skin is fried crispy, but the bean and egg flavor is not enough inside.\nAs for the soup, the base is sweet and sour. It is quite delicious with Catfish (but it is more oily)\n\nIf you want me to recommend a restaurant to hcmc, I will immediately recommend this one and only this one!",

    "description": "Hola Amigos! This is OUR Tex-Mexican Restaurant in HCMC, Vietnam. I'm (Scott) from Maine, USA & my wife and better half (Duc) is from here in Saigon. What we are trying to do here at La Fiesta is to make some tasty and fairly authentic Tex-Mexican food, served with a smile in a welcoming setting. We make all of our sauces and tortillas onsite, and also use Saigon Tacos locally made Corn Tortillas & Salsa Verde. We take great pride in our work, and strive to do our best to pay attention to detail every single day. It's the little things that count, and that gets lost sometimes. We will all work hard every day to stay on top of our game, and keep you wanting to come back to La Fiesta. Serving tasty Tex-Mex food and drink in the heart of Saigon.",
