    "description": "Great food! Loved the pho. I had the beef and tendon pho. They have large portions for a great price and there are plenty of condiments. I also had the egg soup. The pho was great but I’ve never really had a bad pho since I have been here. For foreigners the pho is a bargain but compared to other places it is slightly more expensive. It’s a great place to chill inside and the customer service was amazing. It’s a Michelin star restaurant so totally recommend checking this out. I’ve had heaps of pho and personally I like stopping into family owned shops with the locals. I wouldn’t pass this by whilst you are in HCM so have a try!",

    "description": "A chic and intimate space living up to its name. This is one of the best spots in Sai Gon to enjoy drinks as the sun sets over Park and Ben Thanh Market. Offering 270-degree city views, the environment created is the best of all worlds. “Luxuriously high enough up to delight in exquisitely romantic views of Park in its entirety, yet close enough to feel at eye level and at one with the city streets and rooftops. Beautifully and atmospherically designed – glass, metal and wood complement a monochromatic color palate of black, granite grey and hints of cream. Background chill-out music creates a trendy understated vibe. The overall effect is one of charming elegance.” The Twilight Bar is La Siesta Premium pièce de résistance – with an extensive range of international wines, signature cocktails, beers and spirits a well as an exciting menu of non-alcoholic beverages.",
