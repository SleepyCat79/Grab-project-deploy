      "This rooftop laundry shop in District 1, right across from Bitexco Tower, is a hidden gem. It’s a simple but smart idea — do your laundry while enjoying a great cup of coffee and a beautiful city view. The prices are fair, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The coffee is smooth and delicious, whether you like it strong or creamy. It’s more than just a place to wash clothes — it turns a boring chore into a relaxing experience. If you’re in the area, it’s definitely worth a visit.",

      "Traditional looking restaurant in a courtyard of restaurants and cafés up an alleyway opposite the Ben Than Market ( north side - Le Thanh Ton Street) and claiming to (and probably is) serving home cooking style meals. Varied though complicated menu - specialist noodle dishes (on a separate menu) are brought in from the place next door - complicate things if you want to pay by credit card. (No fee if you pay by credit card just for food and drink off the restaurants own menu.). Very tasty food, prompt and helpful service. We sat downstairs on long tables, so other diners next to us, as the upstairs seemed airless - without a balcony or window. Breath of salad range and vegetarian options seem limited. Some dishes, like snakehead fish we have not seen elsewhere. Good value – means 100-240k approx, sides about 30k. We spent about 450k between the two of us.",
      "This restaurant was recommended by our guide when we first arrived in Saigon. We went there on our first evening, and then back again for lunch on our final day. It is situated down a narrow alleyway but we found it easily with the instructions given by our guide. (He mentioned that this was his 'go to' restaurant when he was going for a meal with friends.) The restaurant is small and you will generally have to share one of the long tables with other people. You may also need to wait to be seated, though on both occasions the wait was no more than ten minutes (after initially being told that it could be half an hour). However, it is worth it as the food is very good, albeit a bit more expensive than in some other establishments. (And note that the menu price does not include tax which adds 8% to the bill.)",
      "Located down a small street near Ben Thanh Market in Ho Chi Minh City, Bếp Mẹ Ỉn (which translates to “Mom’s Kitchen”) is a hidden gem. Here’s why you should consider dining here: Tasty Vietnamese Flavors: Bếp Mẹ Ỉn serves up authentic Vietnamese cuisine that bursts with flavor. From deep-fried tofu with impeccably crispy exteriors to succulent grilled chicken legs, your taste buds are in for a treat. Fantastic Price Value: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly meal without compromising on quality, this is the place. Bếp Mẹ Ỉn offers a wide variety of dishes at wallet-friendly prices. Friendly Staff: The staff here are warm, friendly, and attentive. Whether you’re a local or a traveler, they’ll make you feel right at home. Refreshing Drinks and Desserts: Pair your meal with interesting and refreshing drinks. And don’t forget to explore their dessert options—they’re delightful! Pro Tip: Try the Grilled Chicken Leg with Chilli Salt and thank me later! Remember, this review is based on available sources, so if you get a chance to visit Bếp Mẹ Ỉn yourself, share your personal experience with others!"

The staffs are all really nice and they make your dininng time feel heartwarm. In particular, Alex was hearty in showing the way, Kayla is an excellent bartender who caters for her guests in a very active, friendly way. I am also especially impressed at Francis for his food knowledge, his friendliness and engagement when serving his customers.

Totally deserving of the Michelin stars he got! Made our anniversary an unforgettable memory!",

      "Saigon has countless restaurants on high floors, but from this one you not only have great views, but also a culinary experience of the highest standard. The truffle mushroom soup was a poem, the fish each exquisite and refined and the service beyond any doubt. We have been to one of the “sister restaurants” in Hoi An twice before and were fully enthusiastic here as well. Prices are slightly higher for the country level, of course, but in all Western countries you would probably pay double for dinner at this level. Accordingly, a fair deal for visitors to the city with high standards of cuisine.",
      "Cloud Nine is a real rare gem! Upon arrival, we were greeted with elegance and great courtesy. The service is impeccable, attentive without being intrusive. Each dish was a work of art, combining creativity, finesse and exquisite flavours. The atmosphere of the restaurant is simply mesmerizing: dim light, soft music, and a refined decoration that invites relaxation. Perfect for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. We spent a moment suspended out of time. An unmissable address for lovers of fine dining!",
      "We came here for our last dinner before leaving Vietnam after a 3 week trip. We chose from the a la carte, their spring rolls were the best we’ve had and we were recommended the fillet steaks which were flamboyantly finished off by our table with flames. We have eaten Vietnamese every day of our holiday so far but although a western dish it had a Vietnamese twist. Staff were attentive and friendly. Views spectacular. Highly recommended for a special meal."

      "We had an amazing dinner at the unique Vietnamese restaurant - based on home cooked food and occupying two homes across the street from each other. You are escorted upstairs to the table and a sumptuous feast followed - in fact a little too much. One specialty is deep fried tofu which we had been told about but to our tastes it was still like tasteless tofu, sadly. The remainder of the meal was excellent however and the service first rate, the ambience was very attractive and we would recommend this restaurant. It is a bit of a way off the main Saigon CBD so you will need transport, we had it all pre-booked. There is a modest wine list and the meal washed down with a good white wine was very enjoyable.",
      "The feel was superb from beginning to end. We’ve been traveling around Vietnam for 2 weeks and this was by far our favorite meal. We ordered an ungodly amount of food because we just couldn’t decide what to pick. My number one choice was the soft shell crab recommended by our waitress. We also loved the ginger chicken, the shrimp and bacon (more like pork belly)(incredible), papaya salad, pomelo salad with shrimp and pork, spring rolls, coconut smoothie, orange smoothie, Tom Collins cocktail, Good Morning Vietnam cocktail (the only thing that didn’t wow me), the fruit platter for dessert, and the herbal jelly. Every bite is flavorful and well presented. The building is interesting and homey. The service was great and the food came out quickly. We loved it! Thanks for a great dinner!"

The baguettes are very good and don't have liver pate on them, which was nice after all these days. The chicken was cut into slices and therefore not so dry and the vegetables were fresh. The Banh Mi here aren't exactly cheap though. One costs between 60,000 and 80,000 dong. The service was very friendly and we also got a free friendship bracelet that is supposed to bring us luck.",
      "These were the first bahn mi of this trip and they did not disappoint the bread was fresh and crispy and the filling’s plentiful, I had roast pork and hubby had the special, we also had a coke and a mango smoothie which was so refreshing, all this for 190000 dong, being given the beautiful charm bracelet at the end is very special and a lovely momento of our trip. The lady who served us was so lovely. Tip- on the back of the menu they have things like how much chilli, coriander or no coriander and many more options so it makes ordering so easy.",
      "Banh Mi very good and very rich! The ingredients are all fresh. Prices more than fair for sitting with air conditioning and soft drinks. The staff is very nice, it also says that if you don’t like Banh Mi at first bite you can say it and change it without problems."

      "Phở Việt Nam - Phạm Hồng Thái is a popular spot in Ho Chi Minh City, known for its rich, flavorful broth and fresh, house-made noodles. Their phở thố đá (served in a hot stone bowl) keeps the soup warm till the last bite. With fast service and a clean, bustling atmosphere, it’s a great choice for authentic Vietnamese phở. Michelin Guide-approved!",
      "Whow what an amazing restaurant & soo cheap. We had their best seller in the sizzling pho, the staff were super friendly and showed us how to make the sauces to go with it. The herbs ect to accompany the dish were fresh and well presented. There was heaps of beef in the soup and they make their noodles fresh onsite. It was busy, we weren’t rushed, it was clean, but mostly the food was soo delicious. We had a great experience here and if we had more time would have gone back. So worth finding this restaurant to have their Michelin Star Pho. Thank you for an enjoyable meal."

      "You shouldn't actually write a review so that it remains an insider tip, but this bar has to be reviewed. The location is in the south center of Saigon and we would always (again) take a taxi to and from the bar in the evening. There is a security guard in front of the apartment building (who also hails a taxi) and only a relatively small sign points to the bar, which you then reach by elevator from the lobby. And then? Wow, good music from various DJs (maybe a bit too loud, you still want to talk), nice people and good drinks of all kinds. We had a few drinks with friends, cocktails, draft beer, soft drinks and juices, everything was great. We were there for many hours and more than enjoyed it! The hamburgers are particularly worth mentioning and outstanding. You should be careful with superlatives, but these hamburgers are really world class! In addition, you sit or dance on a roof terrace with a great view of Saigon, the service is very friendly and quick and everything is affordable. You should definitely go! Crystal clear recommendation!",
      "Awesome vibes, excellent service, friendly vibe and top notch management. Emily will teach you card games, and has fantastic drink recommendations. The staff kept me company while I waited for my friends, ask them about the burgers, the menus, the after parties 🎉 Highly recommended."

      "We always aim for a Sunday Brunch in our travels. We were staying at the hotel so booked into the brunch here. Upon arrival we were met by an enthusiastic staff member who showed us to our table. Our brunch included free flow drinks. There was a choice of four cocktails but I asked if it was possible to have another one and it was not a problem. The beer and wine were cold and readily available if you wished. The food was great - oysters, crab, prawns, lobster, lamb, beef, fish, sushi, salads, dessert, cheeses - and the list goes on. It was an excellent choice of food and no shortage. The two staff members who looked after us were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. It is a great people watching venue. There was a real mixture of people - resident expats in groups, local couples enjoying a day out, groups of friends, mixed ages but all enjoying the afternoon. There was a DJ who played a good range of music. The only thing we didn't like was guys wearing singlets and flip flops. This is a fine dining restaurant. If there is one thing the hotel can do, it is to set and maintain a minimum standard and this should apply to dress. Apart from that, the brunch is worth a shot.",
      "I went here for dinner by myself and Lan Linh F&B server was sooo friendly and supportive taking so many beautiful photos for me as I was here by myself to enjoy. I enjoyed the dinner and the pretty photos of me that she took for me I’m very happy. Thanks Linh! I’ll be back again.",
      "I visited the social club on 6 Nov for my late dinner. An energetic young man Nhan Bui greeted me with a big smile and addressed me to a window seat with a very nice view. He is not only very knowledgeable on what they can offer and also have the patience to identify what s the best solution/food which I might need. What I observed is that he is a very hard working staff, he always serve and clean my table at the right time. I believe it required a very good attention on the customers. Every step he made can let you to feel his passion on serving customers. Overall, food quality met the expectation while the services far exceed. Special thanks to him and his team mates for their kind and responsive services. And most of your team members can speak fluent English. It is really a distinguished competitive edge in the market. 11月6日，我参观了社交俱乐部，吃了一顿很晚的晚餐。一个精力充沛的年轻人Nhan Bui微笑着迎接我，并把我对着一个可以看到美景的靠窗座位。他不仅非常了解他们可以提供什么，而且有耐心确定我可能需要的最佳解决方案/食物。我观察到的是，他是一个非常勤奋的员工，他总是在正确的时间服务和打扫我的桌子。我相信这需要非常关注客户。他迈出的每一步都能让你感受到他对为客户服务的热情。 总体而言，食品质量达到了预期，而服务远远超过预期。特别感谢他和他的队友们的友好和反应灵敏的服务。你的大多数团队成员都能说一口流利的英语。这确实是市场上一个突出的竞争优势。 强烈推荐。"

      "Today I went to meet a friend at Cafe Marcel. Stepping from a busy street I was instantly greeted by friendly staff and a relaxing environment. As it was my first time going there, the server politely explained both the food and drink menu and allowed me time to make my choices. I was promptly given my drink and without being rushed given a generous plate of food. The house made sausages had the perfect level of spice and my eggs were perfect for dipping the crunchy sourdough toast. All in all I can not recommend this place enough. Great addition to Saigon if you’re looking for a meeting point or delicious, fresh breakfast!",

The first time we went we were served by giang and the second time by phuong both were really lovely and helpful explaining the breakfast menu which is great value by the way. You can choose your eggs then your bread and sauce etc, they also have a really good brunch deal. The portions were really big and the food and iced coffee was so so good, would highly reccommend!",
      "This little cafe popped up in the search when we were looking for a flavorful meal on our last day in HCMC and it didn't disappoint. This is a tiny little cafe with seating on the first floor. Interiors are beautifully done and the staff is very courteous. Food items we had were Spicy Shakshuka, avocado tartine & iced phin coffee. Shakshuka wasn't very spicy, just the right amount for beautiful flavors. Avocado tartine was full of fresh avocado mash and cheese. And the coffee was just the right companion to top the entire meal. I would say it's the perfect place for breakfast/brunch. Prices are a little high as compared to other food options in the vicinity - but absolutely worth it..."

It was all amazing, the egg coffee was the best I’ve had by far, if you want to try it or love it already, you have to come here! The Vietnamese coffee was also excellent. The tuna sandwich was delicious and hearty, and came with a complimentary fruit pot. The mango yoghurt was so sweet and flavourful. All in all, amazing food and drinks!

There are a number of them and they all serve great food in a pleasant environment. Previously, my favorite was avocado egg toast, but since they added eggs benedict that has been my go to favorite. They have a whole page of different versions. I, of course, pair it with egg coffee. Potato wedges are optional and make a nice addition."

      "Ask for Jenny! Never been to Korean BBQ. Thought we would give it a go. Wonderful experience. We ordered the meal servicing 4-6 people, it would have easily fed 6. Great selection of vegetables, pork and beef cooked at your table. The meal came with a selection of sauces, quail eggs, broccoli, zucchini and other side dishes. This was followed with a delicious sweet and sour soup with beef and mushrooms. Food was fresh and delicious. Very reasonable priced. Wonderful service and experience.",
      "We had dinner here twice and the service was always lovely. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Food was amazing. We ordered some recommended sets which were delicious and covered meat together with soup and grilled vegies. Highly recommended!",
      "We had never eaten Korean and this restaurant was recommended by the guide. Never regretted a moment. Yumi, our host made a delicious meal for us and made sure we felt comfortable. Absolutely recommended!"

      "We found this restaurant on trip advisor and we're able to get a table on fairly short notice. The menu is some 60 pages long. We chose three chef special items to share and it was plenty of food for two. We also ordered two desserts. The presentation is impressive and everything tasted good. Prices are quite reasonable.",
      "My friends from the US were visiting Saigon for the first time - as they are vegetarian with sensitive stomachs and extremely wary of the tap water in Vietnam, I knew I had to bring them to this hidden gem in Thao Dien. In addition to the amazing and relaxing ambience, Laang has a great vegetarian option on its extensive menu. We ordered several dishes off the menu, including the stewed king oyster mushroom, grilled eggplant stuffed with shitake mushrooms, and stir-fried flat noodles with mixed mushrooms. Everything was delicious and my friends were very happy with the food. The pricing is extremely reasonable (6-15 USD / dish) given the ambience and service. If you visit, be sure to ask for Lukas who is the GM and he'll be sure to take care of you. He has deep experience working in F&B and originally worked in a Michelin rated restaurant in Europe. He's extremely knowledgeable about wines so can provide great recommendations if you're a newbie like me. Overall great restaurant with great service and great people. Couldn't recommend more highly.",
      "Nice restaurant with romance view, nice food and perfect service. I got 110% support from staff to setup a dinner for 19 people, 1 of our guest need to use Halal food and restaurant could support me to bringing the Halal food which delivered from another restaurant. I need to deposit 6 M VND for our dinner and could get it back from restaurant within 15hours, very high prestige. 5 stars and high recommended to visit."

They also served great French fries and delicious desserts like creme brûlée, creamy cheesecake with raspberry sauce and brownies. The place itself is very cute and inviting. The hostess and cashier girls were so welcoming and helpful they made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. My family and I ate here twice and If I lived in Ho Chi Minh, I would be a regular here.",
      "Came here after doing a quick Google search. Was craving a really good burger after eating Pho for almost a month. And this is a really good burger, the bread was one of the best I've tasted, although the meat could have been a little more seasoned. Fries were also very good and the homemade chili mayo that you get for free was the icing on the cake.",
      "Marcel the price of the cake combo includes 1 side dish and 1 water and the cheapest is about 220k, the price of the cake is about 180 in the picture, I ate 2 people with soft, delicious meat cake, the crust is very soft. But since it seems that people order a lot with the order of which one is to be grilled, the wait is a bit long. If you go hungry, you will cry :))"

      "The only best halal food in HCMC. The quality of food served is excellent and delicious and prepared with care. The owner is a dedicated man who obviously cares greatly for his business, his food and above all his customers. Halal food a novelty in HCMC and therefore the prices are higher understandably. However, having eaten at other neighboring restaurants, none satisfied me with the quality of their food as Daun did. Other restaurants were noisy, cluttered and served seriously bland food. I think what has happened is that since halal food in HCMC is rare, other outlets don't care about quality as much since the Muslim customers will be forced to go to these restaurants. Daun, on the other hand, is still dedicated to serving great food. For that I am truly grateful. Don't take my word for it. Feel free to compare yourselves.",
      "This halal & veg-friendly outlet is a delightful find💕 The menu is pretty extensive from Japanese to Western and South East Asian. We chose some healthy options - beef broth, French beans+egg, mushroom omelette & tumeric prawn (not on menu but a request that was graciously met). Mr Soffian, the owner, has a genuinely friendly personality with a passion for good service and great food. Wonderful hospitality! We got to try his egg coffee - a yummy concoction that seems like a dessert in a cup! If you’re after good friendly service and yummy food with something on the menu for a diverse group, you can’t go wrong with this eatery. Vert strongly recommended.",
      "Located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, Dau Restaurant offers a delightful blend of traditional Vietnamese cuisine and modern flair. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with a mix of rustic decor and contemporary touches that create a cozy yet stylish dining experience. The menu features a variety of dishes, but the standout for me was the pho, which was rich in flavor with perfectly tender beef. The fresh herbs and spices added a wonderful depth that truly showcased the essence of Vietnamese cooking. I also tried their summer rolls, which were light and refreshing, with a delightful peanut dipping sauce."

      "Every ingredient in our meal was of a high standard and prepared with great skilk. The steaks were succulent and cooked just to the right standard. The same could also be said for the fresh and delicious mussels as well as the mushrooms, asparagus, and chips. The wine menu was also excellent as was the care given to presentation and pouring. I also enjoyed the decor and the music created an intimate atmosphere that allowed our family to enjoy our time together without being intruded upon or intruding on others. My was an excellent waitress, ever solicitous of our enjoyment and comfort.",
      "Monday night is 50% off night and just as well as prices on the menu don’t include VAT or Service charge. Monday night is quite busy. The restaurant has a great ambiance. You get a great pate aperitif with lovely hot bread rolls. The beef is really good quality and tasty. We had one strip loin (a bit of fat rind but really good) and a tenderloin (like fillet, no fat). Cooked medium rare perfect. The wines are very expensive so went for the beer option. The water was the most expensive in Vietnam 140,000 plus tax plus service! It came from France… no idea why! So it came out as the most expensive meal so far in Vietnam - in spite of the 50% discount. But great meal, good quality and service."

The staff was so very friendly and showed us how to assemble our lunch with rice paper, lettuce, mint, basil, kimchi and the pork/shrimp pancake. The sauce (a mixture of the two provided...also demonstrated by one of our lovely servers) to dip in was so delicious I wanted to drink up the remains! I highly recommend this restaurant.",
      "Went by by by chance and were really pleasantly surprised. Fantastic food. Many authentic Vietnamese dishes to choose from. We chose a combo. Pork, rice, boiled cabbage, fish soup and some other things that I do not know the name of. Not spicy, but oh what flavors. A little noisy environment if you want to be a little fussy, but very good speed of serving. Can really be recommended and here we will gladly come again.",
      "Had a great experience at Bep Cuon Saigon! The crunchy banh xeo was absolutely delicious—light, crispy, and packed with flavor. The pork skewers were a highlight, too, perfectly seasoned and grilled just right. Fresh ingredients and great flavors make this spot worth a visit if you’re in Saigon and craving authentic, tasty bites."

Ordered a couple of beers to be going on with them our starters !! 1 starters each big mistake portion sizes are quite large, wife had the chicken tikka, I had onion pakora both were lovely and the touch of putting you first piece on your plate was quite nice, pakora were spicy and really nice best I’ve had for a while, tikka were lovely big pieces and so succulent. Then we had mains wife had keema mutta (probably spelt wrong) she said it was best she’s ever had just enough spice for her, I had chicken vindaloo, loads of chicken (loads of curry if I’m honest) not quite spicy enough for me usually have them a little hotter but very nice all the same. Portion sizes were quite large neither of us could finish our dishes ! I’d had a garlic naan wife had 2 chapatis not really nice, if we’re ever in HCMC again we shall definitely be back"

The restaurant had a wide diverse of dishes, all freshly prepared.- the lobster’s & fresh seafood were fantastic. The staff were wonderful & explained dishes that we ventured to try. They even surprised us with a birthday cake for my sister & the staff sang happy birthday to her- really nice gesture. There are other buffets in Saigon, but the review on the Saigon Cafe from YouTube- Tim Lee, attracted us the most & we were not disappointed. This is a wonderful experience not to be missed. Thank you Saigon Cafe for making our evening with you memorable- will definitely recommend this to everyone.",

What I love most is the Nem Cua Bể, crispy rolls with pork and crab meat. These are served on a griddle and go well with the Bún Chả. The only downside of this place is the tiny size of the restaurant. It can get rather uncomfortable when it is full of patrons. But I would recommend anyone who visits Ho Chi Minh City and would love to taste good Vietnamese food.",

After the children devoured the pizza we had to order another as it was so delicious! After leaving to go to the recommended spot for mangosteen, we realised we forgot our backpack and the manager/owner went out of his way to drop the bag to us! How kind!

      "Wandering around bustling Ho Chi Minh City in search of a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner, we were intrigued by Rice Field , which is located right at the foot of the Bitexo Financial Tower on the opposite side , hard not to find! Original location all in wood with original Vietnamese details , we had dinner on the ground floor , very young waiters in traditional clothes quick and gentle , menu 'extensive at inline prices being recommended on the Michelin Guide . We ordered more dishes, almost all vegetarian, fantastic fried rolls, other fresh rolls of mixed vegetables, sautéed noodles with tofu and vegetables and fried calamari with vegetables, all great, well presented and hearty dishes, sauces and chilli served separately, however they ask for the degree of spiciness you want. Great idea to bring lettuce to wrap the fried rolls and not get your hands dirty! Really one of the best restaurants we stayed in our three weeks in Vietnam. Recommended! Only note, I would recommend more care in cleaning tables and in the bathroom.",
      "Delicious, lots of it. Good service. Central location but reasonable price with mid-range income, 2 people eat about 500k to be full. You should replace the chopsticks with new ones, the current chopsticks are moldy, reducing the customer experience",
      "I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant and I must say it was a truly exceptional dining experience. From the beginning, the welcoming and relaxing atmosphere made me feel at ease straight away. The dish that struck my palate the most was the fried calamari, crunchy and tasty, with a touch of freshness that made every bite a real pleasure. The fried garlic rice was equally delicious, packed with flavor and perfectly prepared. I can't help but mention the Michelin rice cake, which was truly a pleasant surprise: soft and tasty, demonstrating the chef's culinary skill. The service was impeccable, with friendly staff attentive to our needs. The background music helped create a pleasant atmosphere, without ever being intrusive. I highly recommend this restaurant to all lovers of good food and an authentic dining experience. If you're looking for delicious flavors and a welcoming environment, you can't go wrong with this place! I will definitely be back to try other delicacies on the menu. Five stars deserved!"

      "We checked the menu online and picked a location close to our hotel, and cancelled our original choice of a rooftop restaurant or bar, for our last night in Vietnam. The outlet we visited was packed to the gills and we then moved to this one. Despite being very very crowded with a one hour waiting, the staff at the earlier outlet were exceptionally helpful and courteous. Once we got to our new location, from the very beginning the staff was helpful in accommodating our booking change from 2 guests to 4 and gave us a table as soon as they could and tried to ensure we got seats whilst waiting. Every drink / dish we ordered turned out to be exceptional. The servers were very perceptive and understood our requirements and ensured that they clarified about allergens, and to the extent of limitations we may have about other ingredients. It shows the training and culture of the Brand. They also took pains to clarify that some dishes would not suit us or apologise for being sold out! The (very common) Mojito, or the Sangrias or even the Whey cider were exceptional to say the least. The cheese platters with the toasted breads, the pizza, the desserts (esp the terrine) were fantastic Personally, I found it refreshing and surprising that a chain with outlets across countries and cities, was able to rise above mass production and yet retain flavour, presentation as also service. Highly recommend this to all visitors to Vietnam (and elsewhere), and especially to vegetarians / vegans for the choices.",
      "This establishment offers exceptional value for your money, providing not only affordable prices but also delivering high-quality and satisfying meals. The service is not only efficient but also friendly, creating a welcoming atmosphere that enhances the overall dining experience. With such a positive experience, I can confidently say that I will eagerly return to enjoy the delicious food and hospitality once again.",
      "PIZZA 4P’S, a real hidden gem located in district 1 in ‘mini Japan town’. We were completely blown away by the fresh ingredients that you could clearly taste/sense were fresh! Organic, sustainable, local + homemade cheese, reasonable prices for the quality and sweet/proffesional staff, just a very good experience. Don’t be fooled by the name, there’s much more than just pizza on the menu."

      "Great food at a good price was very happy with what we received. Wife had the Crab omelet with garlic fried rice and I had the 2 sausages with onion rings and oyster mushrooms as a side. 10/10 reminded me of good pub food from home.",
      "I really enjoyed this place. I am a lightweight and I am always looking for a beer with less alcohol and have the ability to order in a small glass instead of a pint or something huge and this place hit all of the dots. It also had probably the best tasting, very low alcohol beer I have ever had - chanh muoi ale (salted lime). Thinking about this place too much and will go back when I am in Saigon again! :)",
      "I did not expect to find ‘real’ craft beer in Vietnam. I am so pleasantly surprised. I got a flight; I had the Irish Stout, Jasmine Red, Session IPA, Pomello IPA, Double Jasmine IPA, and the special Stout (I forget the exact name; it’s an extra charge) It was super delicious! Cherry and chocolate notes. Yum! I had the Pasteur Street hamburger which comes with fries. It was delicious. My wife had the Omelette with crab and rice and it was delicious as well. It was also delicious. We had the fried ground duck with rice crackers and the onion rings for an appetizer. I recommend both. The service was impeccabile. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us order food. Everything is in English so there was no problem ordering. My wife does not like spicy foods, so the waiter made sure nothing was spicy, and brought me some Tabasco to spice up my food. I HIGHLY recommend eating here if you’re in the area. There is a bit of variety in the menu, so you’re not limited to one or two choices. Again, if you like craft beer definitely stop by here … and take a flight!"

      "Very tasty food: we had a couple of salads for lunch – banana flour and shrimp with roasted peanuts and a similar salad with green mangoes, accompanied by fruit juices (passion and mango) plus to finish Vietnamese iced coffee (coconut) and ginger tea. Service was speedy. Our server Ryan was so helpful, responsive and friendly. His English is excellent. Background music is pop, while we were there Vietnamese in a western style but we were told that sometimes it is western music and musicians.",
      "I stumbled upon Hoang’s Kitchen and it turned out to be one of my favorite food spots in the city! I ordered the fresh rolls and the incredibly soft grilled pork with quail eggs — both recommended by Bear, one of the friendliest and most helpful staff I’ve met on my trip. The flavors were bold, fresh, and perfectly balanced. The grilled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and paired with the quail eggs, it hit all the right notes. Bear really went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience — from helping with the order to making great suggestions. It’s the kind of place that feels warm, local, and authentic. Highly recommend if you’re in Saigon and craving something genuinely good and comforting!"

      "From start to finish, Vo Roof, exceeded all expectations, and provided a superlative dining experience in a relaxed and inviting environment. From the moment we entered, the friendly and attentive staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Upon being seated we were served a refreshing starter of cool juice along with wet towelettes to freshen up and clear the dust from our journey through the busy Saigon streets. The menu was extensive and the prices were surprisingly low compared to other restaurants in District 1. Our dishes were served quickly and the food was excellent. My wife and I were discussing whether we could possibly make room for a light dessert when to our delighted surprise our waiter appeared with two small dishes of delicious cubed fruit which was provided free of charge as if they had read our minds. A perfect finish to a wonderful evening out. We will absolutely be returning to enjoy more of the wonderful food, superb, friendly service, and joyful atmosphere provided.

      "The first time I went to La Fiesta I didn't really do the food justice as I was on a diet and so only ate the chicken salad. But the salad was refreshing and the dressing was enjoyable. The chicken was very more-ish too. And the frozen jalapeno Margarita was one of the best, most enjoyable Margaritas tasted anywhere. The next two times I had a delivery of chili con carne which came with french fries, so I made my own basmati rice to go with the chili as rice is my preference and also enjoyed the shoestring fries. I had a side of salad too which was just as fresh and tasty as I remembered. The chili con carne was too much on the mild side for me, although still a delicious flavour, but a couple of sliced red chilis added to the chili soon remedied that and brought it up to the level of spiciness I'm used to. The whole experience was very satisfying and I.m now looking forward to trying many of the other dishes at La Fiesta as well.",

      "This is a lovely relaxed coffee shop that sits above the hustle and bustle of district 1. The cafe is very atmospheric with comfortable indoor seating or section of bar seating on the balcony. Of the coffee options there were clear vegan options (oat milk/coconut). While obviously a little more expensive than more local places, this is still reasonably priced at less than £2 for a coconut coffee with coconut flakes and a complimentary cold tea on arrival. The cafe is above a restaurant, there is a sign for it, and to the left of the sign is a doorway leading to a corridor, at the end of this corridor you go up the steps to level 2. The steps are a decent size and have railing so suitable for anyone who can climb stairs mobility wise.",
      "In April 2024 I visited Vietnam with my son. While we were there, like so many other tourists and locals alike, we both fell in love with Vietnamese coffee and sought out various coffee shops across the country to try their version of the national drink. Tonkin Coffee in HCMC offered some of the absolute best coffee we had during our 3-week stay in Vietnam. We tried out their milk and egg coffees – both were delicious, so much so that we ordered a second coffee while we were there. As we were also hungry when we got to the coffee shop, we had some of their pastries and banh mi. Both were excellent! I should also mention the outstanding friendly service at the café as well. This literal hole in the wall café is located down a long alley hallway and up a flight of stairs, but it is well worth seeking out. I highly recommend this wonderful little coffee shop!",
      "A true hidden gem in Saigon! We nearly walked past it as the entrance is just a doorway, but we’re glad we found it! We both had the Tonkin version of a Vietnamese coffee (mine was iced, my husband went for hot). We also had a custard-filled croissant each which were absolutely lovely! The atmosphere was calm and the staff lovely. Get yourself in!"
