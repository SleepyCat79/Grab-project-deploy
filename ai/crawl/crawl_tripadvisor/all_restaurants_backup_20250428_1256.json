      "I stumbled upon this lovely hole-in-the-wall craft beer nook by chance and kept coming back! Vy (the owner) speaks excellent English and plays such soothing eclectic music. Her beer menu is rich in variety and she has bottles of the hard stuff for the more hardcore drinkers. The place is quaint (with sort of an East Village, New York City vibe). You can sit indoors or out. The price is right, the selection super...",
      "Great selection of craft beers in a relaxing ambiance, listening to great music, they like Coldplay here. I love Dalat."

      "What a great atmosphere! Cozy but nevertheless stylish. The food is absolutely delicious and you'll hardly find any draft beers that tasty in Vietnam. You'll find me here next time I'm in Dalat! :-D",
      "The place is well decorated with beautiful art works- almost as elegant and tranquil as a cafe. We order Sausage Wooden Platter that cam with 3 different types of sausage, bread and side salad- not bad but the highlight was the Beef Blade Steak. For 300.000 vnd, it was delicious and worthy of the money. They also offer a wide range of draft beers. We had Amber and Tilner, both were really nice. Definitely recommend for those who look for a good German restaurant!",
      "Our two families visited this new addition to Da Lat international cuisine scene and were not left disappointed. We had a large selection of many of the offering and all were great. The entire staff was friendly and attentive. I was shown the kitchen and introduced to the cook. The kitchen is as clean and nice as the remainder of the restaurant. We both had rambunctious, noisy toddlers, but they were treated well by all. Will definitely be back. A little off the beaten path, but worth the drive. You will not be disappointed if your hankering for German food."

      "Very nice steakhouse. If you are looking for western-style service and food this is the place. Very attentive staff - Andy the Maitre’d and the rest of the staff are awesome. Steak was cooked as ordered and very tender. Wine by the glass is from Chile (white) or France (red) and is very affordable. If I’m in Dalat again I will definitely return.",
      "After a long days travel through the rainy mountainous area of Đá Lạt, we stopped by for dinner after a quick google search. When arriving, we were quickly greeted by a gracious host who guided us through the ground floor which seemed to be a cafe? The space is a cozy intimate dining area. The menu is in both English and Vietnamese with highlighted recommended dishes. Our choices for the evening were the Dá Lạt salad, crab bisque pasta, steak and mashed potatoes. The da Lạt salad surprised us both. It’s quite plentiful and the vegetables/fruit were fresh. The crab pasta was crabby in flavor, but in a good way. It even came with the shell stuffed with crab meat and cheese baked on top. The steak was seasoned nicely and the pepper sauce paired well. The steak was cooked a tad bit rare for my partner, but she still enjoyed it. We enjoyed the pepper sauce, but it was fantastic with the mashed potatoes. The carrots were cooked very well. Overall, we enjoyed our experience. It’s a good value, it’s good for sharing (you may need 3-4 plates for two depending on how big of appetites you have), and the service is fantasticz"

      "Went went here with our two kids aged 2 and 4. The atmosphere was lovely, very friendly, very helpful staff. The place is a huge barn with small play area and tractor. The kids loved running around and at 5.30pm and it was quiet enough that we didn't annoy other guests. The food is decent quality and a great price. The range of beers and wine is also good an very well priced at 30k for a bottle.of sapporo.or 70k for a nice aussie wine. Would really recommend!",
      "Coming to Barn house since the last time was 2 months ago. I was surprised because the better changing of Barn. Specially, the appearance of cocktail in western restaurant is the extraordinary experience. I must say that, it was extremely great and had a wonderful taste ( The one i had is Little Violet). Besides, waiters are so friendly, enthusiastic and professional. Hmm. I’m still into the Smoked Pork Rib and Kim Chi Hotpot, it was delicious!!!! Honestly to say , Barn House is the best place to enjoy the western food , and from now on, it’s also a place to let the hair down with the amazing cocktail. Thanks Barn for memorable experience when i’m in Dalat.",
      "Good food and good service . Had the salad with seafood and it was excellent Large and clean restaurant with many tables and space between them . WiFi was also good Would recommend and will return"

You should order in advance so you don't have to wait and you can see the grilled chicken before you. Regardless of whether the guests are foreign or not.",
      "The chicken tastes delicious and fragrant. At first I thought it would be good to eat chicken with sticky rice. It turns out it tastes delicious and is also balanced. And the sauce is also delicious and the combination is really good. In addition, the salad dressing is also fragrant. There is no food here that fails at all. The portions are also quite large and suitable for eating together. If you go to Da Lat, you must try the food here. Guaranteed you will definitely like it."

      "My family had dinner here on March 11. For 8 people, we ordered 4 iron steaks (their specialty), a hotpot, 2 salads and a roasted chicken rice dish. The food was excellent. The steaks were very tender, juicy and well seasoning. They could cook the steak to your liking. It was very interesting to see how they cooked the steaks with the iron. The beef hotpot was also very good. The broth was neither salty nor bland. It was very flavorful. They also gave us 2 complimentary appetizer dishes which were very good too. Since we arrived at 5m, we were the only group there. The waitress was very nice. She recommended their specialties and answered all our questions. The restaurant was clean and we did not wait long for our food. Overall, it was an excellent dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially the iron steak.",
      "Such a hidden gem, i couldn’d imagine how good the food were when we entered the restaurant. It was set up and owned by a five star chef so the food stylish and quality are just so good. The portion is big too, 4 of us ordered 4 courses and we left with bigg bellys. Yummy",

      "This spot was an absolutely unexpected highlight of my time in Da Lat. Despite my love for Vietnamese food, after a few weeks in the country, I was ready for something a bit different. I didn't assume much at all when I searched for sushi, but Mimi offered quite the pleasant surprise. Their fish was extremely fresh, beautifully plated, and very affordable for the quality. And admittedly, though I doubted that a place that offered sushi could deliver on their italian food, I was very wrong. The pizza and pasta are delicious, I particularly loved the Pizza Messicana. Da Lat is a small city, so almost everything is a short car ride away. Definitely give this place a visit if you're in the area, you won't regret it!",
      "We eated there sushi,pasta,” etc everything was so good and tasty. Table service is polite and fast and food price is 👌 Definetly reccomend Mimi Sushi 😊",
      "We went for lunch as a family group. The welcome and seating was prompt and very friendly. Drinks orders were executed promptly and served ice cold. We ordered Salmon Sashimi, Crispy salmon skin salad, sea grape salad, beef udon noodles, fuji beef and some pasta. All the food was served quickly and was fresh, well prepared and tasty. Certainly on our list for a return visit during our next stay in Dalat!"

While we were there a group of Vietnamese came in and said \"We forgot what we ordered for lunch, but it was so delicious we want exactly the same for dinner\".The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. The staff were efficient, attentive and friendly throughout our dining experience. It is right beside the Crazy House and is open for lunch as well as dinner.",

Wished we had the time and energy to do a Hot Pot justice because other diners were having a real feast. Great vibe too.",

Tea, milk tea, coffee, smoothies can be ordered in hot and iced options here ^_^ 2. Tastes of drinks are so special and bring us the very Da Lat flavours which we can’t miss out. 3. The snacks and breads are so unique. We saw most of diners not only enjoy drinks but also take some crispies when they paid a visit. Of course, we did, too :) 4. The café is an interesting place to chill out and to get some photos made with the yellow painted wall and pleasantly old-fashioned atmosphere.",

Once come, never disappoint! Highly recommended!",

      "Sometimes you just want to enjoy a beer in peace without loud tourists or cheesy decor. Hood gave me exactly that. It’s the kind of place where you can sit alone, soak in the music, and not feel out of place. The dim lighting, great playlist, and quiet energy were perfect for an introvert like me. Staff didn’t hover, but they were kind and helpful when needed. Honestly, it felt more like a sanctuary than a bar.",
      "I stumbled upon the place by chance while taking a walk near Xuan Huong Lake. The bar was clean, had a wide variety of delicious beers, and the staff were lovely. They even went out of their way to help me get a taxi when I needed one. If you’re looking for a chill spot in Da Lat, you should definitely give it a try"

      "About 10km up the road from Dalat you’ll find a small brick pizza oven under a buffalo skull. Tables supported by log table legs and small pans simmering next to the fire piled high with ribs, baked mashed potatoes, and homemade rustic pizza. Farm house Ale from a jury-rigged kegerator in the corner. A kindly American gent runs the place with his family under the ideal of farm to table, market to mouth, and local specialities. It’s not what you’re thinking, it’s better."

I would prefer the other options in the city of Dalat if you want a full meal. Drinks, cakes, music, and the vintage atmosphere, that's their name of the game. Give the musician some money and choose a song from the book, order some coffee, and you got yourself with the view to enjoy. There is simply no other place like it.",

She’d also brought a cakes special board and so we ordered two of them to go with iced coffees, she popped back to say no chocolate truffle cake. Lovely location on the lake, reflected in its prices for very average cake. Cake finished before first coffee arrived and second one never came."

      "Just at the back of the minimarket, in the small street, this real nice restaurant. We loved the pork belly, shrimps with garlic and fried seafood rice. Not cheap but best till now in our holiday in the mid of Vietnam.",
      "The food looked great and tasted even better. Reading the menu it was hard to tell what we would get. We ordered 3 dishes which was more than enough for 2 people. We had the shrimps with cheese and tamarind, the potato and shrimp rolls and the seafood stir fry with noodles. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",
      "Banh mi bo Kho a hot soup with beef carrots bread. Veggies to add in. Lime and salt and pepper to dip the beef. Super yum. Recommended"

      "This small local restaurant was not far from Dalat market and easily to find. The rice paper served with shredded chicken, chicken awful and sticky rice were mixed together. Sounds so weird but it was very tasty when eating with fish sauce and chilli. Price was cheap and service was fast with friendly owner. The only thing that I did not like was the hygiene since trash was everywhere and no one cleaned my table!"

      "If you need some restaurant food safe to eat and you want to avoid getting the Da Lat belly then try this restaurant next to TTC. Food is relatively cheap and whilst more on the salty side will get you through. Chicken in Da Lat tends to be more tight and harder to get off the bone. For a simple meal before you hit the night market you can try here but there will be other options around the place, you just need to find them. Locals say the night market food can cause trouble for western tummies and we had this issue previously.",
      "I think this restaurant serve tourist groups most of the time coz the way they organize seem to be that way. Walk in customers would find a big space with lots of seating. The food is just mediocre, not too good but acceptable. The rice and soup was cold when serving. For tour group standard this would be acceptable. For walk in ala carte customers, it's a bit off expectation.",
      "This is by far the most subpar Vietnamese restraunt I have been too in vietnam. As a Vietnamese American growing up with Vietnamese dishes, I am well w aquatinted with the dishes and besides the very small portion, the taste of the food was very mediocre. Not even that, when we denied the wet napkins provided to us (which were going to cost a fee if we used it) and asked for dry ones, they pretended not to know and just gave us the receipt. AVOID AVOID AVOID!! I clearly knew they knew I wanted a wet napkin because I understand Vietnamese and they were talking behind our backs about it!!!!"

      "I went here for lunch recently and enjoyed the salad with homegrown vegetables, including watercress & assorted lettuce leaves. It was dressed with the local style Dalat sweet & sour vinegar & was very fresh & delicious. Many customers were eating what seemed like a veritable buffet selection of food at their long table. I asked them where they were from as I overheard them speaking Eglish & they were mostly from Saigon (HCMC). They sad they really enjoyed the quality and wide selection of Vietnamese dishes available at this restaurant. They also had a few kids who were able to run around nearby & have fun without being too close so as to interrupt the conversation at the tables. I noticed live fish in large tanks which had air pumped into them so I guess they had fish on the menu! There is also a bbq set up outside the thatched roof kitchen building, which is separate to the main restaurant building. After I ate I went for a wee walk up solid concrete paths to a western style toilet block! It was then that I noticed 4 or 5 smaller thatched roof huts dotted along the paths & gardens on the hill above the main restaurant. On closer inspection, these were like private dining Burres, all with great views out over the lake. My dog & I had a very enjoyable time eating here and wandering around exploring. Best to go when you have some time as it's a 20 - 25 min drive from the centre of town. There was plenty of shady parking spaces for cars & bikes."

      "Had a lovely experience of walking into this place the food was amazing we had spicy beef soup was so full of flavour and one of the best things I’ve eaten in Vietnam we also got a flavourful banh mi that had the best mushroom pate. 10/10 would recommend",
      "We ordered the vegetarian and spicy beef noodle soup. It was very good (the best pho I ate so far in Vietnam) and that for less than 2 dollars! The drinks are very local, we did not like them that much but definitely an experience!"

      "We've been coming to Bich Cau for years the main reason being the fantastic location. The coffee is secondary, its good but not the best and this time time we noticed that the prices has jumped considerably, almost doubled in fact since last year. However that seems to have happened almost everywhere and by most places standards it's still cheap. Being at the top end of the lake means that its the perfect halfway point on a walk around the lake.",
      "The cafe is right in the middle of the lake and offers a beautiful view. The menu is however limited, so we ended up having coffee, which was very cold and inspite of sending it back it turned out to be cold again. Well maybe the walk from the kitchen to cafe in the chilly evening was to blame for. The staff didn't speak English at all, so had trouble explaining them. I lost my wallet there and they were extremely helpful in finding it, so all my blessings to them."

      "This restaurant is tucked away just beyond the quiet suburbs of DaLat, famous for its cool climate and often hailed as a 'summer retreat' in Vietnam. The pleasant weather and the restaurant's welcoming ambiance create a comfortable setting, ensuring that visitors can enjoy a laid-back and delightful time. The owners, a delightful couple with never-ending smiles, infuse the venue with a warm atmosphere, making us and fellow guests feel like part of the family. At this restaurant, dishes are prepared using fresh ingredients harvested from an on-site natural farm. Every bite became a chorus of \"delicious, delicious!\" as my wife and I happily indulged in the flavors. Especially notable is the curry crafted by the talented chef wife – it's a masterpiece among masterpieces! Once you've tasted it, the deliciousness lingers in your memory. When I visited in 2021, I discovered that even the chicken used in their dishes was raised on the premises. Now, that's attention to detail! The atmosphere of the restaurant is truly homely. Conversations with the staff are enjoyable, and it's an environment where not just meals, but memories, are easily created. If you're curious for more information about the area, don't hesitate to ask! They are likely to share various insights about tourist spots and more. Definitely consider stopping by to experience a heartwarming moment. Highly recommended!

The pork was tough. They charge you for everything from the wet towel-lets they leave on the table. They tried to make us pay for items we did not order and when I refused they backed down. I’m surprised they did not charge us for using the utensils and dishes. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

Below are the points we found noteworthy and wanted to share on TripAdvisor.\n\nFirst, the restaurant space is very comfortable and clean. We had a large table to sit together and the space between the tables was large enough to create a sense of privacy. The interior is beautifully decorated with warm colors and creates a welcoming feel. The service staff were very enthusiastic and friendly, they met all our requests and made sure we felt comfortable throughout our stay.\n\nRegarding food, we enjoyed a delicious meal of broken rice. Broken rice is delicately processed, the rice grains are soft and delicious. We have a wide selection of meats such as pork, chicken and eggs. Every dish is freshly prepared and beautifully presented on the plate. In particular, side dishes such as fried eggs, fish sauce and raw vegetables are also great. The quality and taste of the food really surpassed our expectations.\n\nThe prices are also very reasonable and consistent with the quality of food and service we received. The combination of quality, taste and price created a memorable dining experience for us. We feel that we received good value for the money we paid.\n\nIn summary, we are very satisfied with our experience at this broken rice restaurant. If you're looking for a place to enjoy a delicious and budget-friendly broken rice meal, I definitely recommend coming here. I will come back in the future and explore more of this restaurant's other dishes.",

      "Buffet environment , but the food is really good. So , so many choices to list and the quality it’s really first class. Service also was outstanding. Some things we tried - quail, Frog Legs, crocodile , Shrimp, Pork and Pork sausages and oysters on the half shell all cooked over the charcoal grill at our table. Again too Many choices to list. Plus a Full compliment Salad Bar including fresh fruit. All the things we tried were just great. Many Da Lat loyal locals eat here and the price is wonderful . Full Buffet meal per person is 159,000 VND or $ 6.84 USD per person. This restaurant puts the local tourist restaurant spots to shame with quality offerings and the costs for dinner. I live in Da Lat and will return many times to come. Highly recommend if your craving great Vietnamese Table cooking over a fiery hot charcoal grill or their Hot Pot. It’s a true winner 👍"

      "Some friends and I decided to have a dinner at this restaurant on Christmas eve while we were in Dalat. It was quite a last minute decision and the restaurant at first was reluctant to take the reservation and demanded a deposit. We managed to talk them out of it. The restaurant has a very charming atmosphere with colonial setting - 5-star for the ambience. They had a pre-set Christmas menu. However, since some of us don't eat meat, we managed to change the meat items to seafood. The seafood that I had was only okay, nothing great. The service was quite slow, maybe due to the fact it was full house on Christmas eve. The bill took forever to be prepared. The wait staff were all polite. Apart from great ambience, I don't think the restaurant gave value for money.",
      "This is a lovely place to sit, overlooking the lake. We had been in Vietnam for two weeks so it was nice to go native with a Club Sandwich - delicious! The hotel only had 10 guests (43 rooms) staying. It's a nice old colonial hotel but there is no pool."

For some reasons, I have fondness for the atmosphere, the dark scheme and the quietness of Yu, which is quite suitable for a lonely wanderer. You may find many types of beer here, but I can wholeheartedly endorse the cocktails - maybe the finest ones to be tasted in Dalat - at the very reasonable price. I only visited Yu twice in my business trip, but I will definitely come back once traveling to Dalat again.",
      "I happened to visit the restaurant during the Tet holiday while staying at a nearby homestay. Looking at it from the outside, I didn't think it was a pub, but when I stepped inside I realized. Warm space, moderate lighting, good music, especially the bartender mixes delicious wine. Will visit again in the near future!!!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner"

The staff couldn't really speak English but I managed to get what I wanted. I did notice a mosquito or two outside on the terrace but I'm lucky in that I very rarely get bitten. If I was in Da Lat again I would go back for the grouper fish!"

November is a rainy season for Dalat and the area is foggy around Tuyem Lake. You can just chill out at The Seen House relaxing and drinking a cup of hot coffee.

      "Yesterday I ate nem nuong in a nicer place with the same price 40,000 VND each set per person but received less than in Nem Nuong Ba Nghia. Tonight 2 of us ordered 1 set of nem nuong, 1 banh xeo and 1 small set of fried rolls and like this place more. Cost us 115,000 VND total and we were full. Better value with more vegetables but no garlic. Yesterday there was garlic in the other restaurant. Very crowded at dinner so they forgot the ingredient dish for us which contains cucumber, fermented onion and star fruits, ect. I reminded them and received ours. They smiled and thanked us when we paid and walked out."

      "Very nice setting with nice old building but not for food. We came here with friends after the recommendation of hotel's staffs. Quite far from town by taxi. food was cold and not so tasty I do not recommend it",
      "This place was recommended by our guide for our day tour of Dalat. The outdoor terrace seating area was charming, surrounded by a shaded garden. There were other tour groups eating here so we thought it was a good recommendation. And our guide was super otherwise. But it turned out to be a bad experience for us. I ordered a Caesar salad with smoked bacon and cheese and the okra with soya cheese sauce. I've seen a lot of Caesar salad variations, but this version had no resemblance to the original. Lettuce, some onion shavings, and a vinaigrette dressing covered with smoked UNCOOKED bacon. OK, the okra was very good. One of our party ordered the salmon. The rest of us were almost finished and finally the server came and apologized saying that the chef got preoccupied with a big party and burned the salmon. She asked if we wanted them to start over. Please! Our tablemate asked if they could do a seafood salad quickly and the server said yes. You would have thought they would have comped it, but no. Luckily our day tour was superb so we got over the lunch misfortune."

From there we ordered our cocktails, whiskey sour and margarita. They both were fabulous! We decided on the smoked platter for our meal and it did not disappoint. The waitstaff, the bartender, the atmosphere, and the overall comfort of this bar/eatery were the perfect solution to the cold rainy days of Dalat!",
      "Everything so nice, from the food, cocktail to the service! Totally love this place! “This is absolutely 💯 the best new bar in Dalat, great music, chill Vibes and the sweetest bartenders around. Chi is so friendly and funny it feels like your hometown bar. The fireplace sets off the mood. Definitely call ahead for reservations.”",

These 2 menus are fresh spring rolls witch you can roll yourself. The dish seemed to be very fresh and tasted delicious. Besides you get free hot tea. We where even more surprised by the price at the end. We only payed 60'000 Dong."

One thing can be confusing, the coffee shop cafe is downstairs. The pub is upstairs with the entry on the side. Intimate sized pub with a nice balcony overlooking the little hillside streets of Dalat. The cafe is open 7am-9pm, the pub operates from 5pm till the last customer leaves. :) The building itself is interesting as it is a historic home that has been restored and repurposed. It’s a popular selfie spot. Staff is very friendly and some English spoken.",

I had an amazing Expresso Macchiato and scrumptious almond croissant. The food was delicious and warm. The Expresso had that fancy look. Actually I am enjoying it now. Highly recommend this place as a traveler and first time customer.",

      "Staff were very good and the meal was good for the price. Unfortunately they were closing down because of the hoax virus.",
      "Surprised by immediate serving of free hot tea that tastes fragrant like vanilla/pandan. A wide choice. We chose the braised prawns & mackeral in tomato sauce & special spring rolls. prawns hv a rich peppery and sauteed onions but would be best with less salt. Fish & spring rolls good for 2nd try. We chose a table tt overlooks road & enjoyed a pleasant view. pleasant setting. Staff are pleasant & quick!",
      "Very close to the market. I absolutely loved the meal I had. The waiter was very polite and kind to us."

I was the only customer here and the owners were sitting at a table and sharing a coffee. They invited me to sit with them, have me fresh guava from their garden and told me all about how the coffee is produced. They then took me for a walk around the gardens. Really special place",

      "A Short Review: A Must Visit for: Train Enthusiast, Music Enthusiast, Scorsese Movies Enthusiast (the place looks like any of those New York Cafes from his masterpieces. oh, and Cat Lovers - there's a beautiful & surprisingly friendly (& civil) pet cat always hanging around The cafe is filled with interesting pictures from Trains all over the world. Also, one of the owners happens to be a renowned musician and a pleasant company if you get to meet him. Delicious food at reasonable price, warm & friendly atmosphere and clean & sanitized environment We walked into a warmly lit balcony that we could see from the other side of the street. There were 4 clean and neatly arranged tables with a Coat Hanger. As we walked inside, we were greeted with the subtle Jazz music playing on the speakers, soft enough to have a conversation at a natural voice and loud enough to fill the void between the words. Just Perfect. We were greeted with pleasant smiles from a cute attendant who was wearing a facemask. (It isn't hard to miss their smiles). I had a Hot Chocolate (with 2 spoons of sugar) and she had a glass of delicious red wine (Of which they have a big selection) - just perfect! We have tried an array of main course dishes including all of their vegetarian delicacies. Veg Spring Rolls, Veg Lasagna, Phily Cheese Pizza (my personal Favourite) as well as several vietnamese dishes where they substituted meat with some interesting varieties of Tofu. Like the wine to start the meal, we strongly recommend you to end your meal with their Fresh Cakes (Cake of The Day!) You'd love to meet the charming owners who happen to be at the restaurant often. We strongly recommend you to try & support this restaurant that has been a part of the bustling Tourist culture of the Paradise in Vietnam - Da Lat",
      "I just ate at V-Cafe. The food, service, hospitality and atmosphere were excellent. I would highly recommend going here while you’re in Da Lat. The location is a short walk to the lake or the central city area.",
      "Centrally located . If you are in the town center it's a good spot to go. And as a traveler it seems to be a place to go to meet other tourists Linch or dinner. Good cappuccino too!. We came back in the evening as well as they have an entertainer there on the weekends. nice easy listening music."

The place is always full but well controlled by the owner and staffs so we did not wait for long to be served. We have been recommended by a local friend and definitely satisfied with it.",

You select your barbecue sticks, such as pork, chicken or vegetables at the front, then cook them on a terracotta tile BBQ on your table. The staff were very helpful, as we were not too sure what to do. The food was, fresh, delicious and very cheap - I would highly recommend this place."

      "We stopped at this mountainside road cafe for lunch on the suggestion of our driver who we had asked to take us to somewhere where locals would choose for a lunch stopover while driving long distances. We were in for a total treat! On the menu was wild boar cooked at our table, the most delicious chicken ever - free roaming mountain chickens with a delicious side of sticky rice grilled in bamboo sticks! All 100% local produce. The restaurant looks out onto the valley below, but we sat in a separate hut from the main dinning hut and were shaded by lots of beautiful greenery and flowers. This is one of those rare finds when you just put your trust in a local to lead you to the best place to eat. Well worth eating here. I have photos to add as well when this restaurant is approved, I am just not being given the option at this stage.",
      "Staffsâ€™re so crazy, I waited for over 30 minutes and they didnâ€™t give me a attention. I asked for 3 times and a girl with tablet come and she didnâ€™t answer my questions, the only thing she did was read menu on this tablet without giving me to see and hungry me up to order. After that, they brought me some foods but it wasnâ€™t all I ordered. The foods was normal, honestly bad. My salad tasted rotten, wtf? The price was different from Foody review - an app to review food, it costed and add 15% because of holiday."

Page after page of dim sum options as well as duck, noodles, vegetable dishes to die for--on and on (I wish I could have visited more than the two times I did). And the place is cozy--4 stories with dining on either side, offering varied views. Super service. Very reasonable prices. Delicious!!!"

      "We waited 45 minutes to be served our first dish of the 3 that we had ordered. Upon asking about the other 2 dishes, we were informed that they had not even started cooking them yet; and the place wasn't even busy. Staff were not interested or didn't even care. We paid the bill for what we had ate and left. Terrible dining experience, the worst in Vietnam. If it were possible to give zero stars on TripAdvisor we would, as one star implies a degree of satisfaction or quality, where there was actually neither.........",
      "I really like this place although we did go a little late in the afternoon and it does close at 2. Anyhow we got served very promptly and we ordered things that we didn’t know what they were! As it turned out everything was delicious. From the pot soup to the banana blossom salad to the fried rice, all with loads of fresh herbs. The coconut smoothies were to die for!"

      "We had an okay breakfast here this morning, soup, fried eggs, a couple of white coffees, It's a few doors down from where we are staying, and we found the management quite pleasant and the food okay.",
      "I have visited this restaurant almost everytime i came to Da Lat. the place dated back long before 1975. Owned and run by a family, and probably is the oldest restaurant in town. the food is great; i especially recommend their vegetarian soup noodle, and other dishes with vegetable. they use generous amount of fresh vegie in these dishes. probably due to their long-standing status in Da Lat, the family members seem to never mind changing their own style for a more friendly service, which one can easily found in all stalls, cafes or shops in DL. The staff seems to well preserve their own cool albeit efficient style of treating customers from the subsidy period, when service was provided based on ration stamps. However, if you dont mind their style, you will be able to appreciate the food.",
      "The food here is decent and cheap. We got two tofu entrees, a meat entree, and 3 sodas for about $9. I actually only ordered one tofu entree and a veggie fried rice, but I guess they misheard me? I got the food to go, so I didn't notice the mistake until I got home. They also gave me the wrong drink. I noticed the drink mistake at the store, so it was corrected there. Overall, the food is good for the price. The service was ok. It wasn't great. I may or may not go back again."

Telling story about lonely souls in bustling cities, the hot pot recalls about “cold outside – warm inside” person who always shows their “spicy” traits but owing a tender heart inside. Thus, not only does CHUNGKING EXPRESS fill your stomach but it also brings feelings of being",

      "Cheap and tasty veggie meal of either a huge plate of rice with mock meat & veg of your choosing (just point to what you want behind the canteen style deli counter) or a noodle soup with assorted veggies and mock meats. 55k dong for these two dishes. Price can't be beat. We preferred the veg restaurant near the golden Buddha but this one was decent and near our hotel. Saw a group enjoying a hot pot too. Some of the mock meats are not the hottest but that's to be expected as they're sitting out in a deli style counter. The rice is hot and fresh. Can't fault it for the price paid.",
      "We went early in the morning and we're greeted by smiling staff. Not much English spoken. We were sat down and two bowls of delicious pho appeared on our table. We weren't given a menu...I don't know if they have one. But the food was delicious some of the best pho we've had in Vietnam. Lots of mushrooms and bamboo shoot and some tofu. It cost us only 60 for two."

It designs look like old restaurant so that you can take some vintage photos but it is not special. For the food it is not good as simple as the normal food in traditional markets. We take soup, pork and grilled chopped fish that they say it is specal here but we are disappointed about this. The quality so bad and service is not good. I think they need more effort to become 3 stars. If you want to take some photos you can go there but for eating Vietnamese food you should consider before you go."

      "We ordered a pizza as a late lunch and just happened to see our pizza being delivered a short while later. The pizza was not bad but we did wonder if it would be cheaper if we cut out the middle man. Nice view of the busy street below. Over all a nice place to sit for bit."

      "This busy little dessert shop serves flavorful and surprisingly satisfying avocado ice cream (a famous dessert in Da Lat) in small plastic cups. What the shop lacks in ambiance it makes up in delicious sweets and other dessert. My husband and I visited an hour before closing time but the seats were still crowded with local tourists and families giving us an impression that this shop is indeed quite well-known in the area. On the next night, we managed to pass by the shop again early in the evening to try and sample their other desserts but turned around when we saw an unbelievably long queue outside. The shop had other dessert options like local fruit salad concoctions and fruity ice creams of different flavors. They didn’t seem to have an English menu but at least “kem bo” (avocado ice cream) was easy enough to say.",
      "Stumbled upon this small joint just above the staircase leading to the night market.The Avavcado ice cream n durian blend so well n it is the best I have relished.The other flavors are passable.The Avacado pulp is natural,fresh n so smooth.Visitors must try this combination of Avacado ,ice cream n a local fruit.there is a choice of durian,jackfruit,berries n others."

The price was around 20-25$/chicken. You can order grill meats on volcano stone or other special food. One more thing, if you order their local herbal wine, you had to bought the whole bottle.",

      "While we opted to go for the more tourist friendly restaurants further down the street, we ended up going for this more adventurous option. With the staff speaking almost no English, it becomes a bit of a suprise what actually shows up at your table. But what a good one! All the dishes were absolutely delicious, and the lively atmosphere created by the numerous amount of local families enjoying a Friday night out makes it even more fun. Besides delicious it's also very affordable, all in all can't recommend enough!",
      "While the staff speaks hardly to no English they will try their absolute best to serve you great food. The fried rice is to die for and the beef (that you BBQ yourself on a small make shift BBQ) is incredible. Don't. be put off by its simple appearance, the locals love it and so did we!"

      "Khap Bun Kha - Thai restaurant. - Located on the front of Nguyen Van Cu street, Khap Bun Kha restaurant recently \"emerged\" as a standard of Thai style restaurant quite \"hot\" for young people in Dalat. - The first minus point and seems to be the largest is parking stage. Our group of 4 motobikes came, the old guard sat on the phone, and I parked in front of him for more than 1 minute but he still carelessly pressed the phone. When he looked up to see us ... he ignored, continued to press the phone. At this time, I took the initiative to speak out: where do we park when we go to eat? He did not bother to look at us, his eyes still on the phone. Waiting for 5-10 seconds (like waiting for the message to finish), he lifted his head in the direction of the parking lot with an annoyed expression (his face still looking on the phone) .... Then our group parked motobikes in, after finishing it, he looked up and scowled, it was not parked, moved some motobikes over here 😶. So we had to move the motobikes by ourselves while he was sitting and talking on the phone. I don't know if he is a guard or make statues. So bossy. Restaurant owners should consider this problem if they do not want to lose the first point in the eyes of the customer (the first point is very important). - The restaurant is relatively small, including a ground floor and 2 floors. Our team chose to go to the second floor. The staff were very enthusiastic and cute (different from the car keeper earlier), always smiling and greeting in Thai, the Thai-style uniform is also very impressive. From time to time always smiling. Even during the time of cutting the \"giant squid\" in the hotpot was so cute. - The quality of the food is great (although some of our friends can't eat spicy food), the quantity is quite good. Price is ok. Compared to the group of 8 people who order about 7-8 dishes, the average is about 120-170k / person. Very reasonable. However, the time to serve food is a bit long."

      "On a rainy day, I was in this amazing peaceful and quiet place call La Mappa, enjoying my time with my colleagues and then my working time. This is a good place for you to work or talk with friends. You will love in the decoration, the soft music of the coffee shop as well as its drinks and homemade cakes.",
      "We dropped after visiting Bao Dai summer palace as it was lunch time. Place looked very beautiful from outside and menu quiet ok so we decided to have lunch in here. Very nice atmosphere, decoration, good as a place for relax, but won’t suggest to have meals. Maybe we were not lucky cause of Tet holidays. 1) veeeery slow even while there was just one more table occupied 2) drinks came the last ones and they forgot order of our daughter. But should mention that taste of drinks was good 3) they didn’t have pho, said it is only for breakfast 4) food itself not tasty, but portions quiet big 5) the biggest minus was the bill as first they made wrong calculation (stir fried beef with 600k price for 1 while in menu it was just 245) and also they have Tet surcharge - 20% of the bill! The only place with such surcharge for now. Would suggest them to improve food quality and speed cause atmosphere good. Or maybe just leave only drinks",
      "Nice and comfortable environment, with the symbol of Da Lat- flowers. Food and drinks are yummy and with lots of choices as well. The owner is very nice and friendly to all of her guests. The outlook of cafe brought me into it, first time I feel so glad to get into a cafe. The designs, decorations and furnishings are exquisite. The garden is full of thoughtful flower- plantings."

Ate here as it's connected to the guesthouse with rooms located downstairs below the restaurant and in another property 2 doors away. The rooms are very nice and feature hot showers and all mod cons. The weather in Dalat is very cool so a hot shower in the morning was most needed. The food in the restaurant is of a very high standard and I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner during my stay there. The Pasta and sauces are very authentic and are finished well with a good selection of drinks and wines, highly recommended!",

      "If you're craving KFC and there's none around and you don't feel like street food, Lotteria is the best place for you. Serving fried chicken and Korean inspired burgers, prices are cheap and are quite filling. The chicken pieces are juicy with batter that's perfectly crunchy and seasoned. I loved the cheese sticks and the squid rings were pretty good too. The burgers were quite small but was still tasty.",
      "I wasn't really impressed anyway, but after I had eaten almost the whole burger, I noticed that it was moldy... That ruined everything, of course"

This coffee shop is a great match for those who work remotely in Dalat: \n- Comfortable chairs and table setting, like in an open office\n- Good music, you can focus on your work\n- Good wifi connection and have many charging stations \n- Have tea and water self-refill station \n- Have snack and lunch offering in the menu, with good price\n\nImportant plus: with their business setting, this place doesn't have families and teenagers coming for chatting/selfie. Very few customers in the place, so you can concentrate on your work.\n\nYou can also buy local souvenirs with good price from them as well.",

    "description": "As my husband and I were looking for a good bbq place to eat, we got dropped off at this place by our taxi driver. Our originally planned place was about 10 mins away from this place, when we passed by, it was empty and the taxi driver said it is because their food is not great. He then suggested to go to a place near Tuyen Lam lake, but we refused to go because it was further than where we intended to go after food. \nHe basically dropped us off at the first place he saw. We were hungry so we just went in anyway, hope it might be one of those restaurants that not a lot of people know but it is delicious or something.\nIt turned out the food was just okay. It took awhile to get on the table for sure. The staff were nice but acted like they don't hear or understand me, I speak Vietnamese fluently, not try to confuse them with English at all. They brought out 4 beers instead of 2 like I asked. They took over 30 mins for food to come to our table, which doesn't make sense because the restaurant wasn't crowded at all, there were maybe 2 other tables beside us. \nThen it wasn't the type I ordered. They grilled for us, yet I told them I wanted to grill by ourselves. They definitely took the fun out of it for me. We just ate them anyway. We got 200K worth of beef and 150k worth of shrimps, but as you can see in my photos, shrimps seems to be more worthy for the what we paid. \nMost the time I didn't see any staff, they all went to the back. I had to go look for them to ask for a check. \nI wouldn't go back to this place or recommend it to anyone.",

      "This restaurant is far from downtown. We found out that they only open from 9 am - 5pm. It looks like a stop over or camping ground. We ordered BBQ ribs and a BBQ whole chicken. They were ok. We were expected to see more Texas style but it seemed the restaurant hadn't been ready for the travelling season.",
      "never again! Sent food out.. we sent it back and they still charged us... avoid ! Wouldn’t feed it to my dog... staff rude and lazy Disgusting!",
      "Really disappointed by this restaurant and food ! The waitress were unfriendly and doesn't speak English a lot. So difficult to order a food without traduction and only Vietnamese name. The foot was awful : only fat in the meat and prawns with no taste. For a such expensive price ! You shouldn't go there.."

My meal was very bland, my orange juice arrived when i had almost finished. Not only that the staff were watching you and they had our bill in their hands ready to give you soon as you finished. Not nice at all.",

The service was prompt and the meal delicious. A varied menu but lots of traditional fare. Any taxi driver will deliver you there."

What I didn't realize was that meant lots and lots of mushrooms. I don't mind a few mushrooms but what we were served was an overdose of mushrooms and to be honest the hotpot (it was actually a soup) was VERY bland. IF you manage to order the right meal I believe that you might get a good meal here but ours was not enough to bring us back. There are some strange animals on the menu if that interests you at all...",
      "Stumbled across this restaurant which was not on the review list. From outside it look quite ordinary and the decor was also such.The place seems to be very popular with the local crowd and we could see it's quiet established. We ordered what look interesting on the other tables and every dish turned out to be very good. Even the ordinary looking fried beancurd was outstanding. Glad we had dinner there."

      "An interesting garden full of sculptures and plants drew us into Ami cafe. I ordered a coffee and some food (suppose to be a baguette with egg and veggies). What I received was a soup of 2 minute ready noodles with a burnt egg on top... the coffee was hardly even warm and was horrible. They brought out tea as well (lots of restaurants serve complimentary tea) which again was hardly warm, and tasted horrible. When we picked up the bill we saw that they had added tea to the bill despite not ordering it. Scam, scam, scam."

      "We were not too impressed at what was on offer at the night market so we headed to this restaurant opposite the market and were surprised at how good the food was. My wife had a seafood noodle soup while i had a steak and a bia Saigon. Good service, some English spoken and would definitely visit again.",
      "Absolutely not come back here for the 2nd time. Foods is bad and not look like in the menu at all. The price to compare with other local restaurants is more expensive. But the worst is the service. The girl who take orders was very very rude, not friendly."
