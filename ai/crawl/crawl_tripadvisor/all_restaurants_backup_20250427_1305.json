      "Tasty and delicious food with good service. We had a variety of Vietnamese dishes in this restaurant, the staff were all very helpful and charming, especially Duyen ( see photo ) & the manager Mimi who has good command of English After some weeks in Vietnam we found we were craving some more vibrant flavours, as some dishes in other restaurants were becoming bland .. in this restaurant the flavours were excellent.. the chicken skewers were cooked to perfection and the slow roasted pork ribs in bbq sauce were tender & very tasty!! 🤤 the grilled prawns in tamarind sauce were absolutely delicious so tasty, our favourite!! The alcoholic drink is more expensive than some restaurants. A vodka and Diet Coke (40,000) was 135,000 ( £4.10) and a bottle of dalak wine was double at 399,000 .. whereas last night just around the corner we paid 200,000 a bottle !! A big increase! However the food was good value on the whole we had 4 dishes £18 ( 620,000) .. 2 vodkas one Diet Coke & one huda beer total bill was 885,000 (£26.90)",
      "The food here is very nice. The atmosphere is relaxing. We sat for a long time watching local children playing a game of football in the street, none were wearing shoes. It was great entertainment. After we had eaten, two big tour groups arrived and filled the restaurant so I would advise you to go earlier if in doubt. Our waitress was called Thor and she was very attentive and professional. My mixed vegetables with cashews came with rice and was very nice, perhaps too many onions for my taste but plenty of other vegetables too. The garnishes are beautiful. On Friday and Saturday nights I believe that traffic is stopped from using the street so that’s the best time to go.",
      "We are on a month long trip in Vietnam and Cambodia and decided to stop in here for dinner while in Hue. We were so warmly received by the staff ( especially MiMi), who not only helped us choose our drinks and meals, but schooled us in the use of chopsticks. My husband had chicken mushroom soup, and he and I both had chicken brochettes with rice, which came with a varied selection of fresh and grilled vegetables. The menu is extensive ( both Western and Vietnamese choices) and one meal was more than I could finish. I highly recommend this restaurant in Hue, with its homey feel and wonderful staff and food."

      "The small restaurant is located away from the hustle and bustle in a side street; we ate on the terrace on the first floor, which made it pleasantly quiet. We had papaya salad with shrimp and fish in the claypot - both excellent, especially the quality of the fish! The owner was super friendly and didn't charge us for the extra portion of rice we ordered. The portions weren't the biggest, but they were sufficient and the slightly higher price (around â‚¬10 for both dishes + drinks) was really justified for the quality and taste of the food. The restaurant is definitely worth a visit (or several).",
      "We have been to this restaurant twice during our stay in Hue and it will certainly not be the last! The dishes are excellent and the menu allows you to taste all the typical dishes of Hue at low prices! Special mention for the spring rolls which are excellent, the best we have eaten since our arrival in Vietnam! We are always very well received by our host. She is smiling and gives good advice, she takes the time to explain to us how each dish is eaten, which is very appreciated. The upstairs is very intimate with few tables which allows you to eat in peace. I recommend, you can go there with your eyes closed.",
      "Between 2 adults we shared an appetiser of Hue fried spring rolls and pork cooked on lemon grass skewers (to wrap in rice paper) and a main course of crispy noodles with beef. The whole meal was delicious just wish we could have squeezed in more food. Three dishes, one Huda beer and 2 mango smoothies totalled 340K VND. Had to go back a second time for the spring rolls, a chicken curry and Hue noodle with fried pork and vegtable. We highly recommend this restaurant."

      "Visited on an exceptionally wet day for tea and cakes. The selection wasnâ€™t extensive by the time we arrived but we ordered a carrot cake and a banana cake with hot drinks. We were directed to sit upstairs rather than at the counter and found that the stairs were steep and narrow. A lady coming down missed the last step and stumbled heavily into the stools. The cakes were just okay and not particularly large for the price but the ethical nature of the enterprise makes this acceptable.",
      "I could have missed this cafe, which occupied a narrow shop space, if not for the cafe sign. I read the reviews and thought I would check it out, since I was in the vicinity. The slice of banana sponge cake paired with a cup of cafe au lait was a welcome teatime snack in the afternoon. The cake was not too sweet, despite having slices of caramelised banana on the top. I found myself a table on the 2nd floor, with its colorful decor. For a quiet afternoon, do give this cafe a visit."

The yellowtail was so fresh, I could cut it with chopsticks, and it melted in my mouth. Our waitress, Thanh, was constantly keeping an eye on us, & her outgoing friendliness made us feel like we were at home. Cảm ơn, Thanh!",
      "Japanese spectacular, I'd say the best I've ever eaten. Kim is lovely. They served us in an amabilisima way and even invited us to an extra dish that was delicious. The place is very central, we located it on trip Advisor and found it very easy. Quite a hit! Thank you Kim!!!",
      "We love sushi and in our 3 week trip in Vietnam wanted to have the experience. We found this hidden gem in Hue and the experience was great. We tried two tempuras: sweet potato and shrimp and then a boat with 40 pieces of sushi rolls. It was unbelievably served and we think it will be difficult to find other place in the world with such quality and value for money (CAD $35...). We have traveled a lot, and we never tried something so well prepared and presented. When you are in Hue, please, go there and indulge in."

They were also very helpful and knowledgeable about the dishes, which made the choice so much easier. Being low season, the restaurant was quiet, but we made our own entertainment, so as a couple it might lack atmosphere at this time of year. Saying that, the staff make up for it.",
      "We went to Le Parfum for the Degustation Experience which had been highly recommended to us . With good reason. It was really beautiful . Seven delicious , perfectly balanced courses beautifully presented. The service was impeccable . Wine list was quite limited but adequate-only two Aussie and two NZ wines on offer. We decided on a French Chardonnay and a Syrah which complemented the food perfectly. The wine however was very expensive. This seems to be a common theme in Vietnam with very little Aussie wine on offer and we have had numerous discussions about how to remedy this. All in all a really top quality offering.",

      "I recently visited a charming restaurant in Hue City, Vietnam, with a beautiful view of the Imperial City. The ambiance was serene, offering a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy a meal while overlooking the historic site. Food: The menu had a variety of classic Vietnamese dishes. I tried the Bun Bo Hue, which was rich and flavorful, offering a perfect balance of spices. The Stir-Fried Noodles with Chicken were cooked to perfection, with tender chicken and fresh vegetables. The Fried Rice with Shrimps was light yet satisfying, and the Chicken Spring Rolls were crispy, with a delightful dipping sauce that tied everything together. Each dish was authentic and delicious, showcasing the best of Vietnamese cuisine. Staff: The staff were extremely nice and friendly, providing excellent service throughout the meal. They were attentive without being intrusive and made us feel very welcome. Should give some tips from my perspective as they made me feel really welcome to their country. They also serve us with some banana at the end of the meal. Price: Surprisingly, the prices were pretty cheap, considering the quality of the food and the stunning view of the Imperial City. It was excellent value for money, making it a great spot for both locals and tourists. Overall: This restaurant in Hue City is a gem, offering delicious food, excellent service, and a memorable view of the Imperial City—all at an affordable price. Highly recommended!",

      "We were in search of a quick Banh Mi lunch to go and found this on Google. We ordered the Vietnamese pork and grilled pork sandwiches, which were slightly more expensive than the typical Banh Mi but more substantive with more meat which they seemed to cook to order and was more saucy and flavorful. While we waited, they gave us wet wipes which they cooled with ice, as well as 2 bottles of water (we must've looked overheated after spending the morning in the Imperial city!). They even moved our scooter out of the sun so it wouldn't be hot."

      "I requested my driver to bring us somewhere local for lunch. He recommended us this place. At first glance, I thought it was high-end and expensive, I was thinking street food place and this was where he brought us to. This was a nice restaurant hidden in a garden, many seating areas. It was cozy and very vietnamese in terms of decoration. We were tired after visiting the Imperial City and weren't having much patience looking through the menu. We opted for the Vietnamese sets on the menu, we got two different lunch sets, the two most expensive ones, but I assure you, they are still quite cheap. We didn't regret it. We finished every dish, it was tasty and flavourful. The portions were great, we got to taste so many Vietnamese dishes, we lost count. The selection of drinks were great too. Overall, it is worth the money to dine here. It is certainly not the cheaper selection, but if you want to try many Vietnamese dishes in one seating, this is the go to place, I highly recommend it. We went there after lunch hours, only 1 to 2 tables of customers, very chill place. I don't know whether tour buses of tourists will dine there during lunch hours, if that's the case, this place will be full and service might not be as good. We were there after 2pm, yet service still was slightly on the slow side, I don't know whether it's considered fine- dining, the serving time between dishes is not short! If you want to have an AC place, drink some wine and dine Vietnamese dishes, do give this place a try.",
      "Creative presentation of dishes . We ordered 2 set menu for the 3 of us as the portions were quite big. We especially liked the crispy duck , pancake and grilled lemongrass fish. Restaurant is set amidst a lush beautiful garden . However it was rather dark when we arrived for dinner and couldn’t see much of it The restaurant was quite packed and reservation would be advisable"

      "The food here was really good, and the owner was very kind in discussing the menu. The fig salad was amazing, the other food was good. Prices were a bit more expensive than some of the very cheap eats we've been finding, but definitely still a very, very affordable meal - about 100K for many menu items. This is a small family restaurant. The seating area is a nice, shaded outdoor space. This place is definitely worth a visit for the fig salad alone! They also provided a really nice rice cracker as an appetizer and a yummy plate of fruit as a standard part of the meal.",

Moreover Ha with his bright smile will be keen to make you discover your country. Not to be missed."

      "Restaurant with a power house of a woman running front of house (and cooking when required). She’s welcoming and lovely - we had a variety of delicious things such as ban kheoi (crispy omelette pancake shrimp / pork) banh cuonh, crispy noodles and more. All washed dow with local beer huda- she opens the. With a karate chop and gives you the opener and hopefully you’ll load up a picture of you and her bottle opener somewhere. Great fun. Great food. Beer and 4 x different things were 175k. If you find the plates small - order more - they’re only like A dollar or 80pence each. Lovely. Come often if you can!!!",
      "Located near gate into imperial Palace we had lunch here before meeting our tour guide. All the staff are part of one family and they create a great vibe in their place - even showing us old photos of the restaurant. Must try the fresh made crispy pancake- WOW so good I wanted more. Local beer at 15k - cheapest we found in Hue. Spring rolls,fresh shrimp rolls ,stir fry vegetables with crispy noodles and banana pancakes with chocolate sauce . Add 3 big ,cold beers and all for 280k. Party trick to open the beers a surprise. Amazing place 👏"

      "Turned up here after dinner on Christmas night. Hue had been wet and misty so when the skies were clear we took our chance! I think if you are in a couple or a group of 4 this is probably a great bar. We were a group of 12 and because of the narrow nature of the bar it was hard for them to seat us, despite it not being that busy. Cocktails took a while to come, again they clearly don't normally do large groups. However they were well executed Cocktails. I had a daiquiri, the other half a long island iced tea. The staff are polite - so polite they waited until 11.10pm to say they had closed at 11pm! We only manged one drink but there was a good view of the city. Best seats are at either end of the bar. Worth a look if the skies are clear. Worth noting that the bar is enclosed."

      "An evening at An Nhien Garden Vegetarian Cafe is an experience that no matter how long or how far you travel in Vietnam, will likely be the ONE place you just can't get out of your mind. We had the good fortune to meet Nhien who is the co owner with her sister An (thus the name An Nhien which in English sounds like \"Onion\"). And just like an onion, a meeting with Nhien is one where the complexity of this very special lady is revealed like the peeling of an onion with each layer revealing yet another side of this extraordinary woman. This property has been in the family for over 460 years!!! The idea of opening up this concept came about gradually and includes an entrance that begins at the grand gates which once entered is like coming into a magical world out of time and space. Whatever worries you may have experienced before entering, just melt away as you are instantly transported to a lush garden, expertly lit with subtle mood lights, gorgeous antiques and stunning artwork by an amazing buddhist Monk. All of this happens before you even get to the restaurant which is comfortably tucked into the back of the property like a lotus flower which seemingly opens just for you. Unlike most restaurants, the staff here are not just workers, they are emotionally connected to the purpose of this experience and their joy is as real as their commitment to creating an evening that surpasses your expectations. The food, the presentation, the attention to detail, the whole experience felt much like a Michelin restaurant.. that is if Michelin restaurants offered food that wasn't just a feast for the eyes and a gift to your waiting pallette but, also served with a love from the heart that can not be trained. There are sites to see in Vietnam and places to go but however you travel in Vietnam, if you want to experience something that will be a priceless gift to remember your whole life, come to An Nhien to immerse yourself in a timeless epicurean adventure that will leave you satiated both in body and soul!",
      "I’ve never had such delicious vegetarian food. I didn’t realise Vietnamese people enjoy vegetarian meals. Often times I’ve only had the standard fare of spring rolls and Pho. The food in An Nhien Garden is such a delectable eye opener. Service was good and food even better. We had the hot pot and my goodness, the broth was out of the world. The lotus fried rice was very good. Food portions were just right and service was excellent; they speak French and English so we were never lost in communication. Ambience was calming and the restaurant is within an old bungalow with a lovely garden. Only thing is the pricing was on the pricier end.",
      "This restaurant was part of a food experience/ cooking class organized by Intrepid Adventures. The staff and hostess were very knowledgeable and the cooking class was a lot of fun. We were also able to tour the ancestor house and beautiful grounds and artwork around the restaurant which was an old family estate in Hue. We then enjoyed a lovely lunch in the vegetarian restaurant. The hostess went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and was able to help me with a health concern as well! Thanks Nhien!"

      "We happened upon Dai Nam restaurant by accident. It was beautiful and very clean inside. We were a party of 6 just coming from the Citadel and were exhausted and hungry. Our waiter, Dat spoke English and helped us through the menu. We ordered spring rolls for the table and my husband ordered Shaky Beef and I had pork with mushroom and onion. All of the food was fresh and delicious and Dat was super helpful and personable. This was a great choice",
      "Đai Nam restaurant is located in the garden of the lovely Spatel d'Annam, a really attractive boutique hotel across the street from the Hue Citadel. We came across it when we were walking back from the Citadel to our hotel across the river. We really just needed to use the toilet, and there was a WC sign near the front of the hotel, so we went in (with some trepidation). Although we were sweaty and dressed for sightseeing - and it was a very hot day - the hostess was extremely graciously and invited us in to the pretty garden area outside of the hotel, showed us to the facilities, and then showed us around the hotel and restaurant with evident pride. It's a really beautiful place. We came back to the restaurant that night, a little more presentable than earlier in the day. The setting is gorgeous, with seating indoors and outdoors. We ordered Bò Lúc Lắc and \"Shaky Prawns\" - both delicious. Service was impeccable. A thoroughly enjoyable evening. One of my favorite meals in 3 weeks in Vietnam.",
      "Every dish was delicious! Duck with pineapple, beef la lot, banana blossom salad - all were amazingly tasty. Inside an historical building - highly recommend trying this restaurant."

      "Delicious food. I chose the set menu and everything was great. The waitress even helped make my rice paper rolls in front of me. The iced chocolate was also very nice and helped cool me down from the searing temperatures outside.",
      "Nice restaurant at the end of an alley right in front of our hotel, found thanks to our guide, offers Vietnamese cuisine. Aside from the menu, two set menus are offered, we opted for the less abundant one because the portions are always enormous. Soup with fish, sautéed vegetables, pork with caramelized onions and prawns in tamarind sauce, accompanied by the inevitable white rice. Home cooking at a very affordable price.",
      "Wow! We walked down this tiny alley following a sign saying “food” expecting street food. What an amazing find. My lady saw a great looking fish on the counter and said I want that! I chose the set menu. It was more than enough for 2 and each dish was better than the last. There were 7 different items served and each was a dish I’d never had before. We came at 14:00, between lunch and dinner as they were preparing for a large party yet the owner personally brought us each dish I live in Vietnam and usually eat out, anywhere from street food to 5 star. This was the best dining experience I’ve had in all my time in Vietnam."

The quality of the food was absolutely superb, cooked on the spot for us and totally fresh. The ingredients used were first class and everything was perfectly seasoned. We can particularly recommend the bamboo skewers and had prawns, squid and duck. It was all totally delicious and there was also a choice of quality wine, as well as local draught beer. We would highly recommend this family run restaurant.",

      "This restaurant is such a gem! It’s located on a small island right by the river, which already makes it feel special. The building itself is beautiful, with a cozy and relaxed vibe that makes you want to stay longer. It’s the perfect spot to escape the hustle and just enjoy some quiet time with amazing food. The menu offers all kind of Vietnamese dishes ranging from multiple choices of protein to vegetable or rice and noodles, and everything we tried was super fresh and full of flavor. The spring rolls were crispy and delicious, and the Beef with pate sauce was one of the best I’ve had. The meat was fresh and tender, the sauce is rich in flavor. You can tell they really care about the quality of their food. What made it even better was the view. Sitting by the river, especially during sunset, was such a treat. The combination of great food, friendly service, and the view made it one of the most memorable meals I’ve had in Vietnam. If you’re in the area, definitely check this place out.",
      "Nice and modern new place, opened a month ago, very nice on an islet of Hue. Large spaces with some acoustic problems. It offers a more refined cuisine with a very rich menu. We had beef with pâté, excellent, squid with tamarind sauce, very good, and an appetizer made with shrimp and pork salad that convinced a little less. Very kind and friendly service, excellent premises for a promising future. To try.",
      "Food is amazing and staff are even nicer! They were so helpful and kind - especially Phuong Trinh!! We tried lots of dishes and were too full to finish them so they packed them up for us to go! Beautiful location as well right on the Perfume River"

      "My wife and I popped in on the way past as we are craft beer lovers. This place has a great selection of craft beer, cider and also whiskey from around the world. There is plenty of seating and staff are helpful and attentive. Prices are reasonable and there are choices of glass size from the drinks on tap. We would have had a drink here every night, my wife was also more than likely going to buy one of the cool canvas bags available. However when the bill came we were charged for the \"refreshing hand wipes\". These were given to us along with a dish of peanuts, we didn't ask for them or need them. They were only 5,000VND so not expensive, but, if something is being charged the customer needs to be informed. Due to this we won't be coming back as it feels like a small scam of getting extra money from a customer.",
      "Came here on a Sunday morning lunch after a tiring morning visiting all the sites. They did not have cooked food before 4 pm but had the sausage cheese and olive platter. Binh offered to get food from another ( the Nook) restaurant so we did not have to go looking elsewhere in this heat. The wheat craft beer on tap was great ! My friend sprained her ankle , he even got us a spray from the pharmacy. This is going above and beyond ! Thank you so much !!",
      "I had the opportunity to come here and look forward to coming back again. The atmosphere is great, their beer is varied and has many different flavors. Must try everyone Special thanks to Mr. Vu for giving me many travel experiences as well as delicious places to eat!"

      "Amazing Burgers and Draft Beer in the Heart of Hue Ngon Burger is hands down the best burger spot in Hue when it comes to both quality and price. The ingredients are fresh, the flavors are spot on, and each burger feels carefully crafted—not something you find everywhere. Whether you’re into the classics or want to try something a bit more unique, there’s something on the menu for everyone. What really sets Ngon Burger apart, though, is the fact that they serve draft beer—something surprisingly rare in Hue. It’s the perfect pairing with their delicious burgers and adds to the laid-back, welcoming vibe of the place. If you’re in Hue and craving a great burger (and a cold beer to go with it), Ngon Burger should be your first stop. Highly recommended!",
      "We really enjoyed some 'comfort food' at Ngon burger. Our kids age 11, 9 and 6 loved their burgers and hubby and I had a chicken baguette. It was huge and really tasty. The customer service was exceptional the place had a fun atmosphere and view of all the activity happening in the street. Thanks for having us.",
      "Tasty burger with good quality meat. The cheese was similar to usual american burger quality and the sauce was delicous! Pickles were ok, not traditional dill and I think the brine is not quite right. However it was okay. Fries were very good. The owner was very sweet and offered complimentary watermelon afterwards. I highly recommend this place if you want to take a break from vietnamese food for lunch. Also not greasy! So you do not feel to heavy afterwards."

      "Delicious dishes, excellent pizza, much better than many Italian pizzerias, the pizza was rightly juicy and not dry, not contaminated by local flavours, the gnocchi with delicious fish bisque, the fillet a little small but so soft that it could be \"cut with a breadstick\" the accompanying vegetables are crunchy but not tough and the puree is excellent. 4 beers. Vanilla ice cream made with whipped cream and vanilla all for $35. What can I say passed with flying colors",
      "Amazing ! If you want to eat burrata, arugula or even truffle, it’s ideal. We feasted. The portions are quite large and the staff are lovely. What a pleasure to find a little bit of Italy in Vietnam! 😍 For the price it’s around €10 per pizza but it’s worth it for our palate!"

      "My wife and I were traveling back to Hoi An by train and Mr Pho’s place stood out, it was clean, well organized, and right across from the train station. We bought sodas and bottled water (fair priced and cheaper than all the other places around). Mr. foe is a kind gentleman who came out and attended to us; very polite, articulate, and professional!. Very knowledgeable about Hue and all there is to see and do here. We’ll stop back in on our next visit to Hue, and have a bite to eat too! Still can’t get over how clean and organized Mr Pho’s is! Wish more places were like this). Safe adventures!!",
      "Hopped off the train in Hue was feeling super overwhelmed with all the taxis and people. I say down at Mr Phos place, ordered some food. He was so helpful, and not pushy and face me some great advice. The food was yummy too :) He offered to help sort a scooter rental with luggage drop off for 500d, which I didn't take but in theory I should have as we ended up spending far more with a different company. Later in the day I was wandering around train station like a little lost puppy dog looking for a toilet, he saw me shouted asking if I needed help and let me come over and use his toilet. Anyways. You rock Mr. Pho."

Our shakes were freshly made, very tasty and very reasonably priced. Lots of western or Vietnamese options on the menu. What made it for us was that the service was so lovely, the waitress was really friendly and wanted to sit down and chat with us, which we were very happy to do.

The on-site art gallery is breathtaking. Lovely view of the river. The drinks are a bit more expensive than other places but it’s definitely worth it and the cocktails are strong but tasty. We played uno and pool with other games available free of charge. Would definitely recommend.",

The setting is beautiful on the bank of the Perfume river, and being providing a refreshing shot and fresh fruit on arrival is a nice touch. However, the best thing here is the staff. They couldn’t have looked after us more. We played pool together and had lots of laughs each night. Many thanks to Tim in particular for being such a great host! I hope we meet again soon!",
      "We really enjoyed stopping by for a few drinks during our vacation. The staff were wonderful and very easy to talk to! The drinks were delicious, and the bar offered several complementary items that were a very nice touch! (A welcome drink/shot, welcome fruit plate and waters for the road). Being right on the river was very relaxing! We did not play any games while there but the bar also had games to play as well. 10/10 would recommend! Variety of people. Good for friend/couples/individuals etc. there was also a family dining while we were there."

      "The place is super, as is the music, the cocktails and the friendliness of the staff! As soon as you arrive they offer you some fresh fruit to welcome you, a shot (to drink Vietnamese style, if you want to know what that means, go for it! 🤩) and a game to pass the time! Very nice idea, also for giving up your phones every now and then. The only flaw is the location (perhaps a little too secret) and the cocktails which are very, very good, also accompanied by various snacks, but also quite expensive for Vietnamese standards. In any case, don't miss it! ✨✨✨",
      "We randomly found this nice cocktail place. Cocktails are a little more expensive than at other bars (from 150k) but when we sat down at our assigned table, they served a plate of fresh fruit and a welcome shot. Later we got free snacks (pringles), and when we paid everyone got a bottle of water. The staff was very friendly and the cocktails are good, however the White russian is very small.",
      "Amazing staff, awesome atmosphere and really great place for drinks! The staff are all so nice, and very friendly, they cannot do enough for you! You also definitely get your value for money with the cocktails as they are absolutely not watered down! Located down a quiet side street it’s definitely worth a visit! During our visit we also got a free fruit platter, nuts and sweets, and fresh table water which was very nice! Along with table games to play such as jenga. Highly recommend! Don’t be put off if it’s quieter than the bars on the main roads, it’s a little hidden away but totally worth it for amazing service, great drinks and the friendliest staff we’ve met in Vietnam!"

She is always smiling and checking if things are okay We left the restaurant feeling satisfied and happy",

      "Initially we picked this restaurant as it has a snooker table and our son has become really into pool on this holiday. However we were very pleasantly surprised to discover that â€˜Why Notâ€™ also has a great variety menu, very good food and such friendly and professional service. We didnâ€™t feel in any rush to eat- and- run as the ambience is perfect, music isnâ€™t blaring and the facilities are clean which is not a common combination in SE Asian restaurants. We have eaten lunch and dinner out every day for the past 8 weeks travelling through Asia, and this place stands out as a firm favourite. We are now in Hoi An so want to try the restaurant here too.",
      "We went here for a late lunch on New Year's Eve. Very welcoming staff, and clearly popular with some regular expats/tourists for its pool tables. An unusual mix of Vietnamese and Mexican food, and we stuck with the Vietnamese food. My choice (beef) was not great, but seemingly just a bad choice; all other members of the group had excellent food."

      "What a wonderful surprise to find a great spot for fresh tasty Japanese sashimi and sushi in Hue. We live in Vancouver, Canada and know our Japanese food pretty well from travel to Japan and our local Japanese restaurants. Kyodai in Hue had exceeded all of our expectations for fresh sashimi in Vietnam. We know Vietnam is great for seafood but hadnâ€™t ventured to a Japanese place over the past three weeks of Vietnam travel here. This was picked on random and could have been a big mistake. It wasnâ€™t!! We ordered one of their Sushi Platters to start that had a variety of sashimi fish on top that was all fresh, firm texture and tasty, their Tempura Prawns were really big prawn pieces and came with a lovely deep fried tempura batter, the Agadashi Tofu came as expected with a creamy soft tofu texture and the last Tobiko fresh fish small roe dish was crunchy and tasty. All in all, 10 out of 10. Weâ€™ll return for a repeat before we leave town in two days!!",
      "Excellent delicious and fresh food, and good service too. The restaurant is down a little alley off the main road, with both and inside and outside space. We had tempura prawns, edamame beans, a sushi platter and udon beef noodle soup. Some of the best food we have had in Vietnam!",
      "Our family of 4 had a delicious meal. The sushi was incredibly fresh, and the Teriyaki Salmon was perfecty cooked. We would absolutely go again!"

      "This restaurant is not in the touristy area, but is definitely worth the 20 min walk or 5 minute taxi ride. We were attracted by the diversity of cuisines; French, Vietnamese, Italian, plus the great reviews. We met the charming owner, Jennes, who is ethnically Vietnamese but was raised and lived in France. The menu is enormous- 50 pages and is as thick as a book. But Jennes guided us to selections that he had the materials for that day and that he thought we would enjoy. We had French cuisine; lamb and chicken dishes with fabulous sauces and side dishes. A huge and delicious Mediterranean salad started the meal with a Chilean Sav Blanc, and Creme Brûlée and Grand Marnier snifters finished it. While expensive compared to the typical Vietnamese meal, it was only $60 USD. I would guess a $200 meal in the US. The location seems dodgy; it’s definitely not in a neighborhood that is touristy. Our GPS told us to walk down some railroad tracks. Just take a taxi. The setting and ambiance is wonderful; open, outside in a large courtyard with quiet seating areas, a pool, great lighting, nice table sets, beautiful bar. It also is a hotel with rooms that look quite inviting. Highly recommend if you’re ready for great options that include fine non-Vietnamese food. I’m sure that the Vietnamese food is great as well - the chef and kitchen clearly know what they are doing. Service was excellent, but hard to really know as there was only one large party of 20, then us. Jennes is charming if you get a chance to meet him. Fun to hear a Vietnamese man with a French accent.",
      "We discovered this restaurant for lunch quite be accident, and so glad we did. It's hidden away in a quiet area with a hotel and huge pool. The menu is large and both Vietnamese and western food. So many great choices. Our lunches were wonderful. Service was great. We plan to go back for a dinner.",
      "We stumbled across this restaurant and will forever be glad that we did. The owner was incredibly friendly, the menu extensive and there was a lovely atmosphere. I saw on the menu before we visited that they offered gluten free pizza and couldn’t believe my eyes! I have yet to find a restaurant serving gluten free pizza in Hanoi. The gluten free base was crispy but not hard. The pizza was HUGE and the cheese plentiful. I didn’t enquire about cooking methods and cross contamination, but didn’t have a reaction which is fantastic. We would highly recommend this restaurant, particularly if you are a member of the gluten free/celiac club."

Nevertheless, we pointed and ordered, and what we got was tasty and of course vegetarian, which meant The Vegetarian was able to eat like a true local without fear! Not geared towards tourists, for us this was its charm. Enjoy the adventure!",
      "We did not know where to start from when we wanted to order. We were recommended a set lunch and took it. We did not like the jackfruit, which in fact did not look like jackfruit to us. We liked the \"rice paste with green bean filling wrapped\", turned out to be something like the \"chee chrong fun\" we have in Singapore. Delicious. The spring rolls were good. They only have fried ones. Aloe Vera drink must have. We communicated via google translator and the staff was very patient.",
      "This place serves up delicious and cheap vegan food in a lovely setting. The menu translations range from quirky (cauliflower turned out to be broccoli) to mysterious (no idea what Twelve Predestined Affinity was). Being all vegan you can’t go wrong with being brave and ordering something adventurous sounding. We were intrigued by Fried Bumps and went for it - it turned out to be bok choy. The crispy fried jackfruit was a standout. A definite must when in the area."

      "Finding Tinh Gia Vien wasn't easy, it looks like a normal house with no obvious signage. Once you've found it you select from one of 3 set menus. Here each menu is based on the old imperial cuisine. Each menu has 9 dishes, which I believe because the emporer believe 9 to represent long life. You'll also find each dish is impeccably presented being served as peacocks, chickens and elephants, which is down to the emporer being a picky eater and needing every encouragement to make him finish his dinner. The prepetation for each dish must take some doing and you'll not leave the restaurant without being absolutely bloated. You'll have some photos too."

The fruits are all fresh and plenty of varieties. The egg station is fully stocked with veggies and meats. They even had a huge salad spread and different cooked Veggies. Coffee is very good and fresh.",

      "Our local guide brought here here after a visit to the DMZ. It's excellent. The menu is simple - but everything on it is tasty. We ordered BBQ rolls, bake rolls and 2 rice noodles with BBQ meat for lunch. They offer spicy or non-spicy fish sauce (nước mắm) and peanut sauce. They are all tasty in their own way.",

      "This spot looks great online but turned out to be just a tourist trap. The decor is supposed to be traditional Hue style but looked rather garish and more like Chinese to us. The food was mediocre and the service was even worse. We got the request to pay in VND because \"the credit card machine is broken\". When we came up short on cash, they suggested we could pay in USD but then completely botched up the exchange rate (not sure if that was intentional or not). The manager had to intervene and apologize for the \"mathematical error\". We came away with a very bad feeling about this place. There are better dining options than this in Hue, e.g. the excellent Com Nieu Chan establishments.",

      "We actually went to the Madison Trang in Hue and found ourselves near here today and decided to check it out - it was AMAZING! The food is very reasonably priced, the portions were large, and the food was actually good. The Bun Bo Hue + Bun Thit Nuong was really delicious. Highly recommend",
      "We all tried the set menu, with different Vietnamese food. We had a small taste of everything and It was simply delicious and cheap. Big portions, we almost couldn't finish everything. Thank you to Trang the owner, she is literally one of the sweetest person. Highly recommend it",
      "My, by now 77 years old mother, and me often visit Vietnam. Hue is one of our favourites spots in the whole country. An important part of feeling so well in Hue is Trang, the owner of this Maison Trang 2 Restaurant as well as a very nice guesthouse and a beautiful other location near the beach. She became one of our best friends in Vietnam. The food being served is absolutely amazing. All dishes have the noble touch of the previous emperor cuisine. It is always difficult what to choose since every dish is a culinary story of it's own. However, prices are still very moderate. I recommand Maison Trang 2 as one of the best places to eat in the centre of Hue."

      "This nice restaurant offers a relaxing atmosphere. The food was very good and we have had an excellent service. The chicken with lemon gras and the noddles with beef plus garbage with garlic have been freshly cooked. The garden area is also very nice to be seated. As it was raining we preferred to sit inside."

      "We visited quite late in the evening - away from the main strip ( which is horrid and full of badly dressed Europeans) and had the restaurant to ourselves save for a young Vietnamese family who joined as we were leaving. Excellent local dumplings and dipping sauce. The lemongrass pork kebabs were also excellent. Super meal.",
      "We come here in the first day in Hue city at 3pm based on the information of our hotel reception. They inform me that this Restaurant in the central area and we can try good traditional cakes and noodles of Hue. This restaurant located in walking are so that after eating you can go around the streets and enjoy some exciting entertainment for example coffee, bars, music ... around there. For the food i think this restaurant is ok and traditional flavor. If you don't want to go to many restaurants to try all kinds of cakes and Hue noodles you should go there. The service is fast and reasonable price."

We ordered rice paper rolls for starters and a snakehead fish in claypot and chicken stirfried noodles. The rolls were very fresh, the fish was delicious and so were the noodles. This restaurant normally closes at 10 and we had arrived at about 9.49..expecting them to give us some bad news. But they happily welcomed us and the service was amazing. To top it off the hotel was great too!"

      "Not a fancy place, very local style and limited menu. That’s exact what we enjoyed, simple tasty and incredibly cheap vegan food. Yes, the ‘com dia’ is served lukewarm/cold… it’s 12k for a plate of rice, veg, tofu, the dishes are precooked so it’s served super fast. Don’t expect miracles but go with an open mind ready for local flavours and you will leave full for next to no money at all!",

      "This Bun Bo Hue restaurant offers exceptionally flavorful dishes, earning a 5 star rating for its food. While the staff is friendly, they can be overwhelmed due to the crowded environment. The portion sizes and meat quantity may be a bit small for the price. The restaurant's location inside a run down building with minimal decor gives it an authentic feel, reminiscent of typical Vietnamese eateries. If you visit, consider ordering a large portion for a more satisfying meal. Plus, they provide iced tea, a traditional Vietnamese staple.",
      "Best restaurant in Hue. Vietnamese and Italian cuisine with an exceptional value for money. We ate here twice, tasting both Vietnamese dishes and pizza. The Vietnamese specialties are much better than the \"famous\" restaurant always full of tourists in the center of Hue, generous and very tasty portions, the pizza with thin and very fragrant dough, the best we have tasted in Vietnam. With the pizza you are entitled to a free local beer. The happy hour is interesting, free bruschetta in the evening and free fruit for both lunch and dinner. Not to mention the kindness of the owner and staff. Probably due to the fact that it is outside the center it is not very popular, which is a shame, because the manager deserves much more. 5 stars well deserved!"

The food was excellent with complimentary spring rolls before and passion fruit for dessert. Our waitress was very attentive and convivial. I cannot remember her name but she was a student studying to be a pharmacist.",

      "Only one meal available, roast pork with the freshest salad and vegetables with dipping sauces and huge ribbon rice noodles. This is one of the best meals we have had on our family food adventure, simple fresh and so flavoursome. If you are on the road to Hue from Hoi An stop at Ba Suu on right hand side of dual carriageway ( easy to turn around )",
      "This diner is located about 30 minutes outside of Hue, and en-route to Da Nang. They serve only one main dish for dinner: roasted pork belly with steamed rice crepe. The pork is freshly roasted, and the skin is so crispy. The portion is very generous, and best of all, the price is only 50,000 VND per person ($2.25 USD). We wished we could eat more."

      "We stayed at the resort across the street. Rather than eating overpriced pizza at the resort’s restaurant, we ventured out to this living room restaurant across the street. We were welcomed by three generations of the family running this lovely restaurant. While their English was poor, we hit it off right away. After a quick look at the menu, the waitress brought us the most delicious hotpot and amazing vegetarian dishes. The food was fresh, extremely tasty and very affordable (the bill for 5, including drinks, equalled the price of one pizza at the resort) and the service was quick, warm and efficient. The entire experience was as authentic as it can be. We promised to return the next day."

      "A bit out of the way but worth it!!! Apparently the little island in Hue invented the 'com hen' dish (rice with baby clams). Read a blog that mentioned it as the best com hen they had so had to check it out... wow so tasty! The staff speak a little English, it is off the beaten track and its a very local establishment (i.e. not the cleanest) but so cheap and tasty! I had the noodles with clams (with a side of broth) and the fried noodles with a cracker. Would recommend both",
      "We walked here one evening for dinner. It is a little bit of a walk from the main town, but the walk is very safe and interesting in itself. The staff were very nice and gave us English menus. We ordered bun hen, che bap, and sodas. The food was excellent, one of the best meals I had in Vietnam. I highly recommend making the trek to this restaurant while you are in Hue."

      "In addition to seeing the monuments of the royal city, you must try to taste the food of the Emperor Nguyen, a fine-tasting vision and taste of the best experience, starting with this (Ancient Royal Restaurant) the world's most respected \"Dragon Feng dancing Emperor's banquet\". Exquisite dishes, elegant dining environment, in showing the restaurant to give a forever unforgettable banquet, delicious combination with the fruit of the vivid sculptures, this is definitely not the ordinary restaurant can compare! Having not eaten the Emperor's banquet without a dragon-fucking fan dance, is equivalent to not having been harmonized!",
      "This restaurant is located directly opposite Romance Hotel in Hue. We had duck in plum sauce, vege soup, crispy fish balls and sliced salami and savory fried rice all decorated with elaborate fruit/vege carvings of peacock.",
      "The one thing that got the 3 stars was the presentation of the food! It was beautiful however the food was very average. Service was also average. The entertainment provided ( royal music) becomes annoying after the 3rd song. Be careful, they do not accept credit cards!"

The staff were very attentive and helpful, and they gave us some good recommendations. We ordered different kinds of udon, such as beef, seafood, and curry. The noodles were thick and chewy, and the broth was flavorful and rich. The portions were generous and the prices were reasonable. We will definitely come back and try more dishes next time",

      "Went to Revulsion Express Lang co restaurant for lunch, firstly what an amazing building and restoration they have done on the outside and inside of the station, the attention to detail and the architecture of the building is beautiful. The food was delicious and the staff were always smiling and always happy to help. Highly recommend going here for lunch or a few drinks, really great place, and if you’re into railway it’s worth going to see the station.",
      "I recently had the pleasure of dining at Lang Co Station Restaurant, and I was truly impressed. The stunning restoration of the historic train station is a testament to meticulous attention to detail and a deep appreciation for the building's heritage. The food was delicious, and the service provided by Le was exceptional. Her friendly and attentive demeanor made the dining experience even more enjoyable. I highly recommend visiting Lang Co Station for a unique and memorable meal.",
      "Really enjoyed this atmospheric restaurant. Great Chicken Burger, a ginger beer in an air conditioned space. Based right at the Lang Co rail station. Nice coffee list as well before continuing journey over the Hai Van Pass"

It's really hard to find but basically its next to Madam Thu's but it's a tiny kiosk so look hard and you'll see it. Perhaps we were delirious but we walked up and down the street a few times before we found it! When they say single they mean teeny tiny patty, we were a bit disappointed but it was still nice. But go for the double!! Its not a double like you get in maccy d's but a full bun sized patty. We both had the bacon burger and it was amazing, we very nearly went up for another!! Chips were nice too."

      "This place is SO GOOD and SO AFFORDABLE! I wanted to eat more but went for a night snack and had already eaten dinner. I thought I would be able to find other places in Vietnam that would be the same if not better but I did not! No need to go to expensive seafood places, just come here! The crab claws are SPICYYYY, I can't hold my own spice but this was too much for me. The clams were delicioussss. I recommend getting the sampler to try then order what you liked from it.",
      "We had prawns in a spicy garlic sauce, razor clams in lemongrass, mussels in this amazing sauce with peanuts and steamed clams. It was all so fresh - we ordered the clams because we saw them being delivered to the restaurant. I only wish I could read the menu which seemed only to be in Vietnamese - it looks so extensive. We ended up pointing to pictures on the wall. The seafood here was different and really refreshing from some of the more standard places. It was a bit difficult to find and so unassuming but what a great place!!!",
      "We had the crab claws, oysters and prawns here. The crab claws were messy but so worth it, the oysters were unlike anything else (think garlic, shallots and herbs) and the skewered prawns were sumptuous! These dishes were doused with seasoning and sauces which we loved- but yes, quite messy! (Napkins and bathroom obviously available though). Great with a beer as a starter to a night out in Hue!"

      "The set-up of this Vietnamese restaurant is simply amazing! The decor is so beautiful, and the ambiance is elegant and sophisticated. The attention to detail in every aspect of the restaurant is truly impressive. The lighting, music, and aroma all work together to create a warm and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel relaxed and at ease.",
      "Authentic so the place is very crowded at lunch. We had Hue foods in many places and love this place most. Price is low, not tourist price like in downtown. We rented a scooter from our hotel so we rode here after visiting Thuan An Beach."

      "A group of seven of us travelling together visited this restaurant for lunch on 18/01/2018. To enter the restaurant we walked past trees in the form of an arch and along a paved pathway. The building itself was old though decorated in good taste. The surrounding well maintained gardens are quite large with ponds and water features. The food is served in a number of dining halls in different buildings and boast of over 800 seats. We were well received and seated at a clean well prepared table. The staff were attentive and spoke reasonable English. The food served was very tasty and delicious to the tongue. I liked the well prepared sweet and sour dishes. The prawns were out of this world!!",
      "After visiting the King Tomb, our guide took us to this restaurant for lunch. It has such a lovely gardern and fancy house that we felt so relaxing after strolling around. Foods were good with nice decoration. We were served quickly by friendly staffs."

      "We were staying in Hue and wanted a restful day on the beach. The beach bar did not disappoint! We paid 100000 dong each to access the private beach for the day but this was able to be used to against food and drinks which was delicious and towels. The beach is beautiful and clean , the local fishermen were working which was a delight to watch. We took a taxi to and from Hue organised by our hotel and it was very reasonable. Definitely recommend a relaxing day there after spending a day visiting the tourist sights."

There were lots of extraordinary food that I have never experienced and workers are really friendly to people who visit the restaurant. Moreover, the owner of the restaurant said hello and goodbye to each visitors kindly and gave traditional presents too. I fell in love with this place and I am willing to visit once again",

The thing I love the most is services, they are very professional and friendly which I care the most. However, instead of Vietnamese songs, international songs could be better in that environment!!! Btw I love it 😻.",

      "We came here for a group dinner whilst on our Vietnam guided tour. Both when we arrived and also when we left we were the only people in the restaurant and have to say there was a complete lack of atmosphere. The food was very acceptable with a set menu being the choice of our guide, this was pre booked. All dishes were well cooked and decently presented, with special attention given to 2 vegetarians in our group. The food was plentiful and a very nice variety. There seemed to be a little bit of an undercurrent going on as the service seemed a little hurried and there were not many smiling happy faces amongst the staff, this actually appeared to break as either the owner or manager was actually shouting both in the background and even in the restaurant. This became the talking point of the night rather than the quality of the dinner.",

Despite the soothing decor, the place buzzes with life. It is full of young locals enjoying a cup of coffee, chatting and flirting. The front is full of motos. Do not go if you are in a rush. This is a place to order a traditional Vietnamese coffee then sit back and relax while the coffee drips through the filter. The cups come with tea lights underneath to keep the coffee warm as you while away the evening sipping your coffee and chatting.

      "This amazing restaurant is only a few minutes walk from our hotel Thanh Lịch. We recently came for dinner on a cold, wet, rainy night! Beautiful, serene setting with carved wood/bamboo furniture, tall beams and columns, waterfall, koi pond, felt like we were dinning in a pagoda! We had grilled pork skewers, beef stir-fry with broccoli, stir-fry morning glory with garlic, and bitter melon soup. All served with ‘cơm niêu’ rice cooked in clay pot. Everything was excellent! But we especially enjoyed the soup: ‘khổ qua’ bitter melon stuffed with pork and mushroom, cooked in a steamy hot broth, topped with green onion and cilantro. Simple yet so delicious, so perfect for a cold rainy night! Wonderful service, the waitresses were super nice, friendly. Highly recommend.",
      "The food here was not just good but downright stunning and tasty. From the braised fish dish to roasted pork with anchovy fish sauce, each dish left a lasting impression. Returning to Vietnam after a considerable time away, indulging in the local cuisine at this restaurant felt like a heartfelt reunion with the flavors of home. The setting, with its captivating view, made it a perfect spot for a nice family evening. In essence, this restaurant became more than just a place to dine; it became a bridge to the past, a place where the heart and taste buds reunite with the flavors of home. A truly special experience for anyone craving a taste of their own traditions after being away. What stood out equally was the service – the server was incredibly helpful and friendly, making the experience all the more enjoyable. In a nutshell, this place doesn't just serve food; it crafts an unforgettable dining experience, blending delicious dishes with a warm atmosphere and fantastic service. A must-try in Vietnam!",
      "Good food. Good location. Good service. They have many choices such as chicken, beef, frogs…Highly recommended. I visited with my family in Jan 2024 ❤️. I will come back later if i have chance to visit Hue again."

      "Incrediblely delicious meal! Very fresh and lovely presentation. We had soup, spring rolls, crispy noodles, chicken and shrimp. Far better food than we had at the upscale restaurant Sadhu in Hanoi. Kudos to the couple that own Banana Mango. While not centrally located we highly recommend Banana Mango.",
      "Recommended by our guide, this family owned little place, right near our hotel. I'm so glad he did. We had a great lunch; beef pho, crispy noodles with tofu and vegetable stir fry, mango shake and a couple of beverages, all for less than $10 USD and each delicious. The people working there were so friendly and courteous, they easily and graciously absorbed a busload of tourists who swarmed in. Highly recommend!",
      "This is a family run restaurant which has moved location after Covid. We had a gorgeous 4 course set meal for lunch and all the dishes were delicious. The restaurant is a little bit out of the main town but would highly recommend visiting here during your trip to Hue!"

The most interesting thing is the manager there is a local person so she knows a lot of good and cheap restaurants which you might never knows as a tourism or traveler. She is helpful and friendly. She even offered me free water since she knew that I didn't have a lot of money with me. It's the best choice if you travel alone.",

We expected the meal to be mediocre because it is so cool to be up on the 33rd floor overlooking the city but my calamari was probably the best I have ever eaten. Others in our group had sea bass and it was wonderful as well. The service here was great and restaurant and hotel are really beautiful. I would highly recommend it."

      "Some 15 minutes on foot from the Vincom Plaza we stumbled across this place, that's actually an open to street, covered food hall off one of the main roads. We were nearly the only tourists this week-night and came to experience a local place with freshly grilled delicacies. Basically, you choose from an array of skewers with fresh and raw bits of wonderful chicken, beef, fish, shrimp, frog ... (with or without vegetables) placed on dishes in a stall in the center of the hall. All platters have the price per item listed next to them so you know exactly what you pay for what you get. These chosen skewers (or whole pieces of fish and bird) are marked in a roster at your table along with the beers or drinks you get from the refrigerator at the back of the hall. You get a basket pp with slices of fresh cucumber and some big faboulos raw green leaves you can just graze upon) and can also order sides (rice, vegetables ...). While sipping your drink and watching locals your choice of food gets BBQed on a grill in the back of the hall and will be brought to you to enjoy shortly along with three hot delicious sauces. We repeated the 'choose & enjoy' process three times and had a big, delicious, authentic meal complete with slurping, finger licking, pointing and not understanding what they say. Because it's very basic and simple it's not expensive, so you get the fresh pieces of your choice cooked fast and brought hot to your table, Go. Enjoy. Don't fuss. Repeat. Daily.",
      "Best meal in Vietnam so far. Waitress so helpful using translate on phone app. Cold drinks tender bbq pork. Noodles so tasty and Enoki mushroom dishes delicious superb service highly recommend. So far hue favourite city. Started north heading down to ho chi min."

The food was delicious and fresh everyday. Hang and the rest of the staff were so kind and friendly and sincere. They made us truly feel like family. Very professional and always there to answer questions or to have a pleasant conversation. I highly recommend this restaurant if you’re in Hue and also jade hotel is highly recommended.",
      "Delicious food. Very warm and friendly staff who are happy to have a conversation with you. Such a great day to start the day.",
      "Hang and the team gave excellent service for our 4 night stay. The choice of 4 fresh fruits, choice of eggs and Vietnamese breakfast was really good. Each day we were asked if we wanted to order some more food. For our boat trip on the Perfume River, Hang advised us against buying lunch on the boat and instead gave us a pack-up of hard boiled eggs, bread and bananas. This comes into the “exceeding our expectations” category. On our last night we decided to eat at the Jade Restaurant and the suggested set meal was very tasty, with good portions and dishes we had not eaten in other places."

However, the pork dishes were very tasty, there was a smelly sauce for the pork and rice cakes, but the dish that really impressed me was the Chao Bo. So tasty, and the beef just fell apart in my mouth. My wife says the customer service is really good. I plan on going there for lunch tomorrow for more chao bo and to see if the service is that good. It won't matter, as long as the soup is still awesome."

      "We craved some pizza and searched online for a nice place. We came across Nhi’s Pizza & Crepe and decided to give it a try. Definitely worth it! Very friendly staff and they made me a pizza without mozzarella (because of a lactose intolerance) and it was so tasty. The dough is really crispy and everything seemed super fresh. 10/10 recommended if you’re craving a pizza in Hué.",
      "Tucked away in a lane way (Ket 25, Hai Ba Trung) just behind the Cinestar is a little place called Nhi's Crepe & Pizza, which is without a doubt one of the best keeped local secrets that only a few tourists know about that I have come across. Although I have not yet tried the crepes the pizza is by far, one of the best pizza places in Hue City. The freshness of the ingredients and the combination of flavours makes you wanting more. With it's friendly staff, curious locals and it's quite unassuming location is hidden and little gem, a must visit on any tourist or locals Hue's must do list. If you are looking for a great pizza and have time to go out of your way stop into Nhi's Crepe & Pizza for the taste of western culture that even the Italian's would find it hard to match. This not a paid post, I genuinely found this place on Google and am glade I came here.",
      "So I went here with my family and it was so nice. Delicious food/drinks(I had margarita pizza + pineapple juice but my sister got a hazelnut crepe with strawberry and banana and she said that was delicious too). Staff was friendly and nice!"

A first class meal without doubt Vietnamese and served in a comfortable setting only an elevator’s ride to the land of nod. Subtle flavours, attentive and helpful staff who suggested one of the side dishes I was going to order wasn’t the best choice to go with my main course makes such a difference rather than let the customer be always right only for them to believe their choices were ill matched when it’s too late, after the meal. A definite one to recommend.",

      "We came here with our family while visiting the three tombs near Hue. Our driver recommended this because we wanted to eat local food. The price is clear, there is not really a menu. The food was simply superb. First fresh spring rolls. Add two types of sauce. Then noodles with meat and vegetables/salad. Local beer, lemon juice, cold green tea. I can't describe how much everyone enjoyed it. But trust me, it's worth a visit!! Absolutely recommended. Driver ordered food by the way, so not sure if they speak English.",

He took us to Royal  Park restaurant in Hue for lunch. Upon sitting down, the caption told us that they only serve set meal and was reluctant to let us order ala carte.  First he told us that the set lunch for each person is 300,000 dongs.    We then asked him to show us how the meal look like.  He was unable to show it and merely showed us the list of dishes which numbered about 9.  When we said the set meal was too expensive, he reluctant reduced it to 250,000 dong.  It was equivalent to USD 12.5   We we told that each person will be given a set of meal each.  However to our great shock, the dishes were shared with 4 persons and the portion were very small.  I believe we were taken for a ride and I would like to advise all tourist who travel on their own not to patronise thsi restaurant.",

      "We had a fixed menu meal here. The restaurant was fine, food was good. The street (actually an alley) was off-putting because of the construction work being carried out. This, however, did not interfere with a nice evening with a very nice dinner.",
      "Wanted to repay new friend for his hospitality whilst in Hue. Asked concierge where would he go for dinner... afterwards, I could see why he recommended it... it was out of his league.. sounded and was EXPENSIVE...therefore presumed that the meal was commensurate with the price! I, on returning afterwards filled him in as to his advice... I don't think that he will repeat his faux par again! A 12 course banquet fit for royalty.. VD, 137,000 for 1/2, ... 750.000 ( for 5+) I could spend a long long critique on (my opinion) on the meal that was put down or 6 people. But I won't waste too much of your valuable reading time, by boring you with the same old, same old.... if a king was to eat it, after the first coupla dishes... they wouldn't. Be around !! Fare: king Dragon of appetizers .. a ballotine of sweetn sour pickle encased withovercooked force meat.. it was so dry/ overcooked, I couldn't work out what it was. A selection of 4 was on the plate.. all were overcooked and dry, and cold! A chicken n vege soup... an over boiled (dry) fish n vege soup: .. a dry and coarse minced pork n crab meat stuffed in a crab shell n deep fried... etc etc... what the???? Served to royalty???? I could go around a few Street cafes , choose the equivalent dish, and they would not be any worse!!!!but cheaper!!l I am sure that Vietnamese cuisine is better than what we were presented with... even the porkfried rice(?), a dish so so simple... was butchered...were the cooks on strike , and the door man took over?. It appeared so!! The only thing that was up to scratch was the Private room, the accompanying musicians/ singers( I don't speak Vietnamese.. so no savvy).. the wait staff service! A Chilean Red at Vn. 515,000.. and 6 x VnD 750,000 , was very very expensive meal! I remembered paying more at Hanoi a coupla years ago( intercontinental hotel). But.. there was no complaints??? I don't like to review / rate Restaurants, etc negatively , but, this is in my humble opinion, and my knowledge of food, Icall it as I eat!!! Remember, I was only trying to repay my gracious host /friend in Hue for his hospitality. I am embarrassed by the result, I paid the money..the restaurant pocketed it, I was left with ???? Rate. Food... 3.5/10 Service... 8/18 Value. 3/10 Return for 2 nds... would you???",
      "We were steered to Royal Park by our hotel concierge when we requested an 'Imperial Meal.' The restaurant is in an out-of-the-way location and had a number of tour buses parked outside - never a good sign, in my experience. I had the vegetarian option while my friend had the regular Imperial Meal. Neither was very good. Most things were deep fried, and perhaps not even that recently. After I finally asked the waiter (who was trying hard and seemed to be a good guy) whether there was anything NOT fried, I was brought some steamed vegetables and then a plate of noodles with vegetables. The 'dessert' was 3 small pieces of fruit and a very tiny round cake. The meal cost 500,000 dong EACH (about $23 U.S.), which is a very high price for what we received. (By comparison, we ate lunch at a vegetarian restaurant and paid the equivalent of $10 for about 6 dishes!) I'm about to write my review of the hotel, which we liked a lot, but they're losing a star for sending us to this place."

      "Our driver brought us here, mainly because the owner spoke English. The food was good for locals and this place was full when we arrived. The quality of the food was acceptable although not as good as other more expensive restaurant. We had crispy chicken, Pho, spring rolls and roast pork.",
      "Gad mackrel clay pot style. One small piece of fish,some rice , tomato and cucumber. Also had a papaya juice. All for about $6 Australian. 100k dong",
      "Ordered the fried chicken and rice to go. The chicken was perfectly crispy, and served with a small scoop of rice, a couple slices of tomato and cucumber and fish sauce. I was satisfied with the taste but looking through the menu I noticed the prices are relatively high compared to most other Vietnamese restaurants. But this means I paid $3 instead of $1 so not outrageous or anything."

      "This place is a hidden gem!! Ms Ha greeted us with a warm smile. Even though we were the only people for dinner, she gave us enough time to choose food, got us the jasmine tea, made us feel so welcome. The food was just amazing with lots of variety and distinctly tasting, flavourful dishes. It's hard to find a place that offers such kind of fresh and delectable vegetarian food. The restaurant is also very neat and clean. Our best wishes to this place, we hope it grows more popular and continues to offer such great vegetarian food. Special thanks to Ms Ha for her hospitality and care.",

Not by the cocktails themself or the service but their advertising of happy hour, 2 drinks for 1.

      "Nice view with the river and all, but the service was terrible. We just wanted to sit down and get some drinks. We ended up waiting 30 min to get our drinks even though the restaurant were not that busy ( + the drinks was overpriced compared to size and quality). When we wanted to pay the bill, we waited over 15 min after talking to a waiter before they came with the bill. Overall bad service.",
      "Thought I’d have my last evening meal in Hue on the Son Hương. I’d had a daytime beer to escape the heat on it a few days ago & the menu looked decent enough. I couldn’t fault the ambience but the food & service was very disappointing to say the least. I was advised that my choice would take 35 minutes but it turned up 10 minutes later & was cold. I already had my table placing whipped away from me prior to my meal being served & when I complained about the meal I was met with a half hearted apology."

The sauce they cook the egg and meat in was so delicious when dipping the baguette in. The sauce also goes superb with the meat and egg adding a wonderful flavor.",
      "I have been there since 2008 and when i came back this July, the taste was still good. You can choose variety dishes for your breakfast as steak, egg or chicken."

      "Amazing place, food is delicious and people are really nice! You can eat a 100% homemade food and take a cooking class. I had a great time learning how to cook Hué pancakes, Fried Spring rolls and chicken with lemongrass. You must try"

      "I visited this rooftop bar (the Imperial Hotel) for a drink. You can sit outside or inside and have a marvelous view of the city. If the weather is good, I recommend sitting outside. You can see the river and the Citadel and it is wonderful to see the lights come on. You have an amazing view of the French Bridge (built by Eiffel) and this bridge lights in a dramatic way in the evening. This is a great place to relax and have a drink."

      "I ate in this restaurant three times while I stayed at the Alba Spa Hotel. Every time I had a meal here the staff were attentive, friendly and professional. The chef is a very good chef, the food was always very good quality, presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. There is a lot of dishes to choose from on the menu and very reasonably priced. The Vietnamese food was very tasty and I tried something from the Western element (the loin pork with mustard sauce) and that too was tasty and a lovely meal. Pineapple flambé for dessert was delicious. I recommend this restaurant highly.",
      "We had 7 different traditional Vietnamese dishes - it was very nice, very busy so you will need to book",

After the lunch they were so kind to help us also with some directions and advices for the city: wonderful! The younger part of the staff speaks English: you must try this place!",

He arranged as well the menu for us as the members of the family that run the restaurant are speking no english. The local Hué food was delicious. We ate all the Hué-dishes that were displayed on the menu except the Pho. Highly recommendable if you are looking for a place with authentic and local Hué food."

Nonetheless, food were docent and we didn’t have anything too negative to say regards that.

      "This place was massive! We arrived around 10pm and there was a DJ. Although the bar wasn’t full there were enough people to have an atmosphere. It looked fairly boring in the day time but was a great place to go in the night if you are looking for a bit of fun.",
      "This place is very conveniently located in the central district of Hue. Not a great place if you're looking for gourmet food but perfect if you're looking for late night hunger-killing bar food. PERFECT if you are looking to socialize, grab a few beers, and listen to some amazing music from around the world. Staff is very friendly, DJs are awesome, and you will not leave disappointed. Drinks are priced very affordably, and so sticker shock is not much of a pain. A MUST-DO for all travelers in the central Hue area that are looking for some down time and relaxation!"

Service is with a smile and excellent. Liked that the first thing we were given upon being seated was a cool, wet towel. Bathrooms available too.",
      "I happened to pass by and saw a beautiful restaurant so I stopped in to try some spaghetti. The noodles are fragrant with butter and the sauce is very delicious. If I have a chance, I will stop by again!"

The folks were very nice to us. We also had Bun Hen and Bun Bo Hue, all good. And always cold Huda Beer. This is a repeat on the next visit. Mahalo"

      "Had dinner here tonight and it was above average, nothing great but enough to get a pass. Friendly staff who are attentive. We had spring rolls, calamari and 2 pork dishes. The missus had the meal of the night, it was grilled pork with BBQ sauce. The calamari came battered, I was expecting crumbed, so I guess that's on me for not asking. The calamari itself was ok, but the rings were pretty small under the batter. I had the local pork dish with rice, it was a little too chewy for me and the fat attached to it definitely needed to be cooked longer as to make it not just taste like fat. Total cost of meal was $19 AUD, so not too bad. Give it a try, I guess it's like most places, can be hit and miss depending on what you order.",
      "We had a lovely dinner here. The staff were very attentive, maybe they read the last review and have made efforts to improve as we couldn't fault them. The food was delicious, we had the local specialities, they also have an extensive western menu (which we avoided). It wasn't the cheapest place we've eaten but was under 500k for family of 4 including drinks. I'd happily go again."

      "I was delighted to find this little street side cafe on my evening walk. PEACE sits on a quiet stretch of sidewalk in front of Huong Giang Travel on Le Loi just west of the entrance to the ancient, riverside Walking Street. Food is all cooked to order by friendly, eager-to-please staff. The fare is light.....hot sandwiches, burgers and crepes. Beer is served cold and with lots of ice. Can’t beat the price either. I live here, so I’ll come back often!",
      "What's a tasty hamberger! It's only 1 dollar. Staffs are very cute! The location is easy to find, located on the sidewalk and very cool . After eating, you can go to the \"walking street by night\" near by 600 meters."

      "Average pizzas, i think they might have sugar in the dough, which was different from what i am used to, so maybe not a bad thing, just different. Good smoothies! The menu is not quite clear on whats on the pizzas, like the description on pizza Hawaii is \"Five-O\" and there are more examples like that, gave me a good laugh while reading the menu though!",
      "We went to try out Pizza Amour our first night in Hue because we were located just down the street. The food was ok. The Japanese noodle with fried soy was simply spaghetti with fried tofu in a sweet tomato sauce. The pizza was small and the cheese (margarita) came with olives and red peppers which is a little out of the ordinary. It too was ok. The deserts (we tried almost all) were ok, with the crepe with lemon taking the win for best dish of the night. As for the service, if you guessed ok, then good job! The staff were friendly enough. After being seated upstairs though, we were pretty well ignored once our food was brought to us. We had to go back down to order desserts and drinks. The price, although cheap, is reflected in the portion size, making it ok. Altogether once was enough and we didn't return. We wouldn't recommend it as there's better places nearby."

      "On our third day in Hue and just changed accomodation so very close to here. Found Vietnam very disappointing so far outside of Hanoi for food cheap eats. We enjoy a fried rice type of lunch, cheap and fills us up until dinner. Walked passed here after deliberating at a few menus and decided to go in. Completely empty but bearing in mind it’s only 1pm on a Thursday and Hue seems fairly quiet compared to other places we have travelled in the last 6 weeks. I got the chicken fried rice and very happy, well seasoned and tasty. My boyfriend got the pork and shrimp pankcake and thoroughly enjoyed it. Well priced and tasty food. We don’t really expect much in the terms of “service” whilst in Asia, we are backpacking and on a budget, a saved €2 is colossal to us. Service wasn’t bad despite saying that.",
      "The food was excellent and the staff was so warm and welcomingm Haooy hour, all kinds of discounts and free fruit platters. Ambient sounds and fishes swimming around. Would go again.",
      "We went here after a recommendation from our hotel for a lunch, and even had dinner the day after because it was that good. It was without a doubt the best Vietnamese food we had in Vietnam! Try the chicken with lemongrass, shrimps in garlic and the fresh spring rolls. You will not regret it! Very good quality for the price. Besides: if you go now, you have a chance of seeing the two 4 weekold puppy's, who are adorable. Big thumps up!"

      "If you're looking for an authentic, wholesome and delicious cooking experience I would highly recommend Anh's Cookery! We were graciously invited into Anh's family's home to cook three typical dishes from Hue (the secret food capital of Vietnam). Apart from the delicious food, our highlight was the genuine and interesting conversations we had with Anh. He was a really great chef and cool person!",
      "Anyone who visits the food capital that is Hue, is 100% missing out if they don’t take this class. Such a great experience with a very skilled chef. Learned plenty about food, culture and technique and the food was nothing short of absolutely delicious. Anh is also incredibly knowledgeable and has always been more than helpful in answering any questions we had. Great experience over all! In short: Highly recommended and an absolute must-do for anyone visiting Hue!:-)",
      "We're really happy we found Anh's Cookery, it was exactly what we wanted in a cooking class and would highly recommend it. Anh speaks fantastic English and is very personable and talkative. He will pick you up from your hotel and go straight to the market where you can ask him any questions you might have about Hue food and culture as you peruse the vendors. Then he takes you back to his lovely kitchen in a peaceful but central neighborhood in Downtown Hue. There you prepare the food, drink tea and chat about anything and everything. Anh teaches you some practical cooking skills and shows you how to make a variety of dishes. We especially liked the green mango salad and BBQ with homemade peanut sauce. By the end of it we were stuffed and ready for a nap! Overall, highly recommend. We learned how to make some nice Hue dishes and loved Anh's family and kitchen. It was a relaxing, fun experience."

      "Very tasty food! and very friendly and smart staff. They were helping us a lot. And made some discounts or compliments. So thankful to them! And hello to everyone. your friends from Russia, Gektor and Karina.",
      "My husband and I have come here to eat a couple times and the food has been great! The first time, we ordered a 35cm pizza which was NOT 35cm..it was only 25cm (we measured it with a ruler because we were shocked that it was 35cm.. turns out it wasn’t). We asked about the size and it turns out they don’t even make 35cm pizzas because their oven can’t fit a pizza that big.. now that the issue has been addressed, I believe they’ve covered the 35cm option and only serve 25cm. The pizza was one of the better pizzas we’ve had—the crust was crunchy (not soft/mushy/doughy like almost all other places we’ve tried) which was just perfect for us. The second time we ate here we had a burger, which was hands down one of the BEST burgers we’ve eaten in Vietnam! Their burgers seem to be double patties so they are pretty filling, but well worth ordering. Stacked high and topped with melty cheese and fresh garnishes and a small side of fries, the burgers look like they’re straight out of a magazine ..and taste even better! The menu is far too big, however, and their marketing is so so so confusing. They call themselves a burger house but also have pizza, pasta, Vietnamese food, fried chicken, crepes.... if they cleaned up their marketing and served just burgers and lowered their prices, they’d make a killing and would probably jump from #153 to the top 20 or better on the ratings.",
      "We had an awesome dinner here, super good food with amazing flavours for an affordable price. Definitely recommended when in Hue.I also was impressed by the friendly staff , especially the manager on duty, Mrs. Ny (Nhi, i don't remember ) always be smile and take care us. I didn't know that it has the hotel, too."

      "Young people having a great time around simmering hot pots. Ours was tasty, and spicy, but a little boring. Next time we'll stick with side dishes, and hell, maybe even pizza. Lots of unusual combinations to choose from. Then sit back on some of the most comfortable squat chairs we've sat on, enjoy the music, and everyone having a great evening."

      "...really poor service. I've asked twice for fresh chili 🌶️ and still 10 minutes later you have to receive it. I just showed the waiter a picture of chili pepper - let's see if he gets it after a third time. Pizza is undercooked, there's definitely a severe lack of toppings on it. Well I got the chili but it's uncut. I guess I could do that myself with the butter knife. They don't use fresh dough here for the pizza, some kind of prefabricated bread disk that was previously frozen. I am so disappointed my dinner sucks. I only ate a couple pieces, I'm saving room so I can go someplace else and have something else.",

      "If you fancy some old school tradicional Vietnamese food, go to this restaurant. You can order several small portions of everything so you can taste different thighs. The beef rolls with mint leaves are a must! Don't be put off by the lack of westerners!",
      "Not really Hue food because you can see in their menu many dishes of Southern Vietnam. The food is good. The price is reasonable.",
      "If you want to taste Hue traditional cakes or fresh noodle like banh loc, banh nam, bún bò ... it's not a good choice. This restaurant serves dishes for daily family lunch and dinner cooked in Hue recipes. Most of dishes are made from chicken, beef, pork and seafood. We ordered a basic Vietnamese lunch: a dish of stir-fried vegetable, roasted shrimp and pork, a bowl of sweet and sour bamboo soup and cooked rice. Really good taste! It was different from the same dishes' favour in the North and much better than in the South. I can't review its space because we chose a table on the terrace at the 1st floor where we could enjoy streets' view while eating. The price was reasonable, we (group of 3) paid around 200.000 dong for all."

Near impossible to get the attention of the young male staff who sit around smoking instead of serving customers. Currently busy later in the night when showing the World Cup. Mostly locals.

The restaurant is called Cha Ca Ngu Pho with a cozy design style that gives you an appetite when eating here. The restaurant staff was very enthusiastic, she assisted me in making food right at the table, it was professional. Fish cakes with green onions are very eye-catching, served with a sauce called shrimp paste and vermicelli. The taste is very good. I ordered a very frugal portion of fish porridge. Thank you Ngu Pho Fish Cha restaurant in Hue for giving me a wonderful experience when coming to Hue, a new dish!"

Bún chả is served with grilled fatty pork (chả) over a plate of white rice noodle (bún) and herbs with a side dish of dipping sauce. The dish was described in 1959 by Vietnamese food writer Vu Bang (1913–1984) who described Hanoi as a town “transfixed by bún chả.” Hanoi’s first bún chả restaurant was on Gia Ngư, Hoàn Kiếm District, in Hanoi’s Old Quarter. Bún chả originated and remains very popular in Hanoi. Outside Hanoi, across all regions of Vietnam, a similar dish of rice vermicelli and grilled meat called bún thịt nướng is alternately served. US President Obama and world-renowned culinary expert Anthony Bourdain have enjoyed this dish on the time they in Vietnam The fist time in Hue city, Vietnam had a restaurant inside BUNCHA HOUSE, have “BUN CHA – NEM RAN” (Bún chả – Nem Rán) to server you.

      "Coming to Hue, you can still enjoy Hanoi cuisine, why not? I found a restaurant in Hue, the main dish here is Hanoi Fish Pattie. The restaurant is called Cha Ca Ngu Pho with a cozy design style that gives you an appetite when eating here. The restaurant staff was very enthusiastic, she assisted me in making food right at the table, it was professional. Fish cakes with green onions are very eye-catching, served with a sauce called shrimp paste and vermicelli. The taste is very good. I ordered a very frugal portion of fish porridge. Thank you Ngu Pho Fish Cha restaurant in Hue for giving me a wonderful experience when coming to Hue, a new dish!"

      "A family run gem near the citadel gate entrance. The prices are right. 5000 vnd for a cold ice tea. #42 is chicken with steamed rice and veggies for 70000 vnd. Also tried spring rolls for 40000 vnd. All delicious! The veggie plate is a mixture of carrot, cabbage, onion, tomato, string beans, bamboo shoots and a tasty sauce. They even have homemade chili sauce for those spicy folks out there. Over our three week stint in Hue we ate multiple times here. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a delicious lunch of bun bo hue, banh beo, and bun chay after touring the imperial city, the menu has many seafood and vegetarian options in addition to the meat focused items. We were also able to get our banh beo with just the shrimp and no pork. If you want a sit down restaurant and not just a stool near the palace this is a great option."

      "Cute restaurant. Gave me a bowl of pho with egg and beef balls, But I ordered vegetarian fried noodles. I still ate it since I was too hungry to wait for a corrected dish (I'm not vegetarian anyway), and it did taste really good. They also put salt in my orange juice instead of sugar, but they happily rectified it. The food is good, the service friendly however very inconsistent. I'm not sure if it was a language barrier, new nervous staff, or just a bad day for the waitress, but I would happily visit them for another go in the future :)"

      "This restaurant was highly recommended both by our guide and the hotel concierge. The restaurant has two locations in Hue. We ended up going to the one in 79 Le Loi st. A disappointment. First off, they said they had AC. Alltough technically correct (there was a split unit on the wall), they didn’t want to turn it on and they brought as a fan. Then came the ordering… We first ordered drinks: Beers for the adults and fantas and water for the young. After 10 minutes they only brought the beers and they told us that they didn’t have fanta and that they had ran out of bottled water… I ended up telling them to go to a store to buy water (which they did, warm water). We ordered plenty of dishes and each time the waiter said they were very good dishes. Some of them came with different ingredients (which they recognised only when yountold them) and some others they ended up saying after a while that they did not habe that dish. Truly a dissappointment. I just hope the original khong gian xua is better than this one. We’ll not go to try it though….",

      "Food was good, fresh, hot, well presented and tasty. We had 5 dishes and 2 drinks for 250k vnd. Service let things down, a waiter walked around the restaurant with one of our dishes offering it to every table except us. Lemon ice tea took a while to arrive and waitress got our order wrong bringing 2 identical dishes - it was eventually replaced for the correct one. Overall very happy with a decent feed though.",
      "We arrived late in Hue in the middle of a karaoke street night...the original place we planned to eat needed reservations so we kept walking to the quieter end of the street and found this place. More of a locals choice I think as the food and drink was so cheap! Smaller portions than most places but tasty and hit the spot for a quick dinner. Broken rice and beef noodles were the dishes of choice. Inside seating with normal chairs and outside with small chairs.",
      "Good food & extremely good value for money. There is a mix of locals and tourists, but mostly locals seem to eat here. The fried aubergine was delicious."

      "This is so weird as I'm still in this place finishing my beer after not being able to finish my meal - I honestly could not chew it. I'm actually having a giggle as it's my own fault-first night in Hue, not sure of my surroundings!! Stopped at the 1st open air place closest to where I was staying. I was the only customer with 5 or 6 staff and the lovely waitress tried to take my order but spoke no English. I tried to use google translate but it was a bit frustrating. I've never reviewed a place while I'm still at it! To cut a long story short, before I even got my food, my table had been wiped 4 times, sort of like each time I took a sip of my drink. The food was simply the worst meal I have been served in my life! I attempted to chew a calamari ring with no success. You should be able to see it on the plate in the photo. 'Tough as boot leather' comes nowhere near describing this food. Can't wait to experience some of the delicious offerings that Hue has to offer. The staff were hovering around to an uncomfortable extent and I eventually asked the to give me some space. I'm just about to give them some- forever!"

      "Ok, a re-created Royal Banquet at the Imperial Court could be a little bit hokey if you aren't into it, but...if you let your imagination take over, you can have a really good time at this place. And who knows, you might be selected to wear Imperial Yellow - and impersonate the Emperor or Empress. Once you enter from the street, you are in a small courtyard where staff helps you to select a costume fit for an Imperial Banquet. Most are silk embroidered tunics with matching headdresses and, quite frankly, if you are with friends, it's a photo op. Everybody lines up and forms a procession into the dining room, and once seated, a group of musicians and singers takes over. As I understood, the entertainers are students who are studying traditional instruments and musical technique. They sell a very nice CD of their work; I listened to it a couple of times now and enjoy it. The same CD is on sale at the Imperial Palace. The food isn't bad. Course after course of traditional foods are brought to the table, each dish luxuriously garnished with vegetables carved into fanciful shapes. One dish has a pair of carp cut form carrots; another has a dragon made from another vegetable; another is garnished with kissing doves. There were ten courses in all and I particularly liked the lotus seed soup and the steamed fish with onions and vegetables. If you close your eyes for a minute and just think of how it might have been at court, it works. Relax, settle into the mood, and take a walk on the wild side. You'll be surprised how much fun it is.",
      "We had the green mango salad fantastic, the soup also terrific , the fried calamari a bit western and common. Met the owner a wonderful interesting entrepreneur"

Although we were a little sceptical at first, we ate here and never got ill. It was authentic and full of flavour and the owners were lovely. We had pork in flour soup which was fried wontons on the side of a soup with veggies and beef fried noodles which were the best I've had in Vietnam. We also got a noodle soup which had some great flavour! It's certainly not fancy but if you want local and flavour with a smile, go here!"

      "Two of us came here for the first time in Oct 8th. I tried a Teriyaki fried chicken, a Tokbokki and fried chicken rice with sweet and sour sauce. I seemed small but we were too full after the meal. The taste is super duper good. Not too salty, not too sweet, it is perfect. The spicies matched perfectly with each other. I was so impressed and surprised!!!!!!!!!!! But the most amazing part isn’t that. When I paid for the whole meal, the price didn’t high. Compare the price with the quality I didn’t believe that it can be that cheap. OMG!!!! Highly recommend for those who have a chance to come to Hue. You must’ve tried the food in this small and cozy Korean chicken restaurant!!! Obviously I will come back whenever I go back to Hue."

      "After a diet of vietnam food for the past few weeks it was a delight to find this thai restaurant in Hue Although the menu is not in english, the manager took great delight in helping us to choose from an array of Thai food. All staff very friendly and food exceptional. A lively and enegetic place and seems very popular with the young local people. May be a little noisey for some but if you want good Thai food at reasonable prices this is the place to go.",
      "Bangkok restaurant is located on a quiet back street five minutes from the tourist center. It is a family run restaurant and the owner is very friendly and speaks some English. He loves Thai culture and Thai food and one of his family members is from Thailand. He shared several tips with us about sights to see in Hue. We came with an appetite to conquer and sampled many items on the menu. The chicken and egg pad thai was exquisite. The noodles were not overcooked and the dish had just the right amount of spice to give it that essential kick. Unlike Pad Thai in the west it was not too sweet. The tofu dish was excellent and tasted even better than it looked on the menu. We also had the seafood noodle dish and it was spicy with lots of Thai seasonings. All of the portions are generous and you will not leave this restaurant hungry. We will definitely revisit Bangkok restaurant again in the future.",
      "The food here is good and the Thai chef does a great job. The remodel of this restaurant was for the worse. It was so much better when it was open air. It is unreasonably loud to the point that you can't hear the person across from you talking. It has the acoustics of a tin shed, because that's what it is. After coming in early in the day to reserve a table for dinner for a large group, we were assured that we would get a \"special\" table. We didn't. I asked them in advance to chill a case of beer. They didn't. When we asked for cold beer we got warm beer. Every table in the restaurant was screaming \"mot, hai, ba, yo\" and throwing beer cans on the floor. Yeah it's Vietnam and that's normal behavior, I get it, but this place took it to another level. At the table next to us, one guy was passed out laying across the bench seat, with legs and arms dangling on the floor, onto which his dining companion was vomiting. I wouldn't normally blame a restaurant for the behavior of customers but this seemed to be what the owners and management have created, a Vietnamese beer hall full of screaming, red-faced drunks, that happens to have pad Thai noodles and satay. We left after getting appetizers though the fifteen of us planned on staying for dinner but couldn't handle the \"ambience.\" While it wasn't for us, they seem to be doing fine for business. The place was absolutely packed. It's a shame too because the food is good. I won't be back, maybe take out next time."

      "Two of us came here for the first time in Oct 8th. I tried a Teriyaki fried chicken, a Tokbokki and fried chicken rice with sweet and sour sauce. I seemed small but we were too full after the meal. The taste is super duper good. Not too salty, not too sweet, it is perfect. The spicies matched perfectly with each other. I was so impressed and surprised!!!!!!!!!!! But the most amazing part isn’t that. When I paid for the whole meal, the price didn’t high. Compare the price with the quality I didn’t believe that it can be that cheap. OMG!!!! Highly recommend for those who have a chance to come to Hue. You must’ve tried the food in this small and cozy Korean chicken restaurant!!! Obviously I will come back whenever I go back to Hue."

I had a Pho Bo Tai (rare beef) and a pack of ciggies for 50k. Clear broth, incredible noodles, interesting dark green leafy veg on the side, like a spinach. I’ve had a pho a day here and this was one of my favourites."
