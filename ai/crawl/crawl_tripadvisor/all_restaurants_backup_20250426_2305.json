      "This rooftop laundry shop in District 1, right across from Bitexco Tower, is a hidden gem. It’s a simple but smart idea — do your laundry while enjoying a great cup of coffee and a beautiful city view. The prices are fair, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The coffee is smooth and delicious, whether you like it strong or creamy. It’s more than just a place to wash clothes — it turns a boring chore into a relaxing experience. If you’re in the area, it’s definitely worth a visit.",

      "Traditional looking restaurant in a courtyard of restaurants and cafés up an alleyway opposite the Ben Than Market ( north side - Le Thanh Ton Street) and claiming to (and probably is) serving home cooking style meals. Varied though complicated menu - specialist noodle dishes (on a separate menu) are brought in from the place next door - complicate things if you want to pay by credit card. (No fee if you pay by credit card just for food and drink off the restaurants own menu.). Very tasty food, prompt and helpful service. We sat downstairs on long tables, so other diners next to us, as the upstairs seemed airless - without a balcony or window. Breath of salad range and vegetarian options seem limited. Some dishes, like snakehead fish we have not seen elsewhere. Good value – means 100-240k approx, sides about 30k. We spent about 450k between the two of us.",
      "This restaurant was recommended by our guide when we first arrived in Saigon. We went there on our first evening, and then back again for lunch on our final day. It is situated down a narrow alleyway but we found it easily with the instructions given by our guide. (He mentioned that this was his 'go to' restaurant when he was going for a meal with friends.) The restaurant is small and you will generally have to share one of the long tables with other people. You may also need to wait to be seated, though on both occasions the wait was no more than ten minutes (after initially being told that it could be half an hour). However, it is worth it as the food is very good, albeit a bit more expensive than in some other establishments. (And note that the menu price does not include tax which adds 8% to the bill.)",
      "Located down a small street near Ben Thanh Market in Ho Chi Minh City, Bếp Mẹ Ỉn (which translates to “Mom’s Kitchen”) is a hidden gem. Here’s why you should consider dining here: Tasty Vietnamese Flavors: Bếp Mẹ Ỉn serves up authentic Vietnamese cuisine that bursts with flavor. From deep-fried tofu with impeccably crispy exteriors to succulent grilled chicken legs, your taste buds are in for a treat. Fantastic Price Value: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly meal without compromising on quality, this is the place. Bếp Mẹ Ỉn offers a wide variety of dishes at wallet-friendly prices. Friendly Staff: The staff here are warm, friendly, and attentive. Whether you’re a local or a traveler, they’ll make you feel right at home. Refreshing Drinks and Desserts: Pair your meal with interesting and refreshing drinks. And don’t forget to explore their dessert options—they’re delightful! Pro Tip: Try the Grilled Chicken Leg with Chilli Salt and thank me later! Remember, this review is based on available sources, so if you get a chance to visit Bếp Mẹ Ỉn yourself, share your personal experience with others!"

The staffs are all really nice and they make your dininng time feel heartwarm. In particular, Alex was hearty in showing the way, Kayla is an excellent bartender who caters for her guests in a very active, friendly way. I am also especially impressed at Francis for his food knowledge, his friendliness and engagement when serving his customers.

Totally deserving of the Michelin stars he got! Made our anniversary an unforgettable memory!",

      "Saigon has countless restaurants on high floors, but from this one you not only have great views, but also a culinary experience of the highest standard. The truffle mushroom soup was a poem, the fish each exquisite and refined and the service beyond any doubt. We have been to one of the “sister restaurants” in Hoi An twice before and were fully enthusiastic here as well. Prices are slightly higher for the country level, of course, but in all Western countries you would probably pay double for dinner at this level. Accordingly, a fair deal for visitors to the city with high standards of cuisine.",
      "Cloud Nine is a real rare gem! Upon arrival, we were greeted with elegance and great courtesy. The service is impeccable, attentive without being intrusive. Each dish was a work of art, combining creativity, finesse and exquisite flavours. The atmosphere of the restaurant is simply mesmerizing: dim light, soft music, and a refined decoration that invites relaxation. Perfect for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. We spent a moment suspended out of time. An unmissable address for lovers of fine dining!",
      "We came here for our last dinner before leaving Vietnam after a 3 week trip. We chose from the a la carte, their spring rolls were the best we’ve had and we were recommended the fillet steaks which were flamboyantly finished off by our table with flames. We have eaten Vietnamese every day of our holiday so far but although a western dish it had a Vietnamese twist. Staff were attentive and friendly. Views spectacular. Highly recommended for a special meal."

      "We had an amazing dinner at the unique Vietnamese restaurant - based on home cooked food and occupying two homes across the street from each other. You are escorted upstairs to the table and a sumptuous feast followed - in fact a little too much. One specialty is deep fried tofu which we had been told about but to our tastes it was still like tasteless tofu, sadly. The remainder of the meal was excellent however and the service first rate, the ambience was very attractive and we would recommend this restaurant. It is a bit of a way off the main Saigon CBD so you will need transport, we had it all pre-booked. There is a modest wine list and the meal washed down with a good white wine was very enjoyable.",
      "The feel was superb from beginning to end. We’ve been traveling around Vietnam for 2 weeks and this was by far our favorite meal. We ordered an ungodly amount of food because we just couldn’t decide what to pick. My number one choice was the soft shell crab recommended by our waitress. We also loved the ginger chicken, the shrimp and bacon (more like pork belly)(incredible), papaya salad, pomelo salad with shrimp and pork, spring rolls, coconut smoothie, orange smoothie, Tom Collins cocktail, Good Morning Vietnam cocktail (the only thing that didn’t wow me), the fruit platter for dessert, and the herbal jelly. Every bite is flavorful and well presented. The building is interesting and homey. The service was great and the food came out quickly. We loved it! Thanks for a great dinner!"

The baguettes are very good and don't have liver pate on them, which was nice after all these days. The chicken was cut into slices and therefore not so dry and the vegetables were fresh. The Banh Mi here aren't exactly cheap though. One costs between 60,000 and 80,000 dong. The service was very friendly and we also got a free friendship bracelet that is supposed to bring us luck.",
      "These were the first bahn mi of this trip and they did not disappoint the bread was fresh and crispy and the filling’s plentiful, I had roast pork and hubby had the special, we also had a coke and a mango smoothie which was so refreshing, all this for 190000 dong, being given the beautiful charm bracelet at the end is very special and a lovely momento of our trip. The lady who served us was so lovely. Tip- on the back of the menu they have things like how much chilli, coriander or no coriander and many more options so it makes ordering so easy.",
      "Banh Mi very good and very rich! The ingredients are all fresh. Prices more than fair for sitting with air conditioning and soft drinks. The staff is very nice, it also says that if you don’t like Banh Mi at first bite you can say it and change it without problems."

      "Phở Việt Nam - Phạm Hồng Thái is a popular spot in Ho Chi Minh City, known for its rich, flavorful broth and fresh, house-made noodles. Their phở thố đá (served in a hot stone bowl) keeps the soup warm till the last bite. With fast service and a clean, bustling atmosphere, it’s a great choice for authentic Vietnamese phở. Michelin Guide-approved!",
      "Whow what an amazing restaurant & soo cheap. We had their best seller in the sizzling pho, the staff were super friendly and showed us how to make the sauces to go with it. The herbs ect to accompany the dish were fresh and well presented. There was heaps of beef in the soup and they make their noodles fresh onsite. It was busy, we weren’t rushed, it was clean, but mostly the food was soo delicious. We had a great experience here and if we had more time would have gone back. So worth finding this restaurant to have their Michelin Star Pho. Thank you for an enjoyable meal."

      "You shouldn't actually write a review so that it remains an insider tip, but this bar has to be reviewed. The location is in the south center of Saigon and we would always (again) take a taxi to and from the bar in the evening. There is a security guard in front of the apartment building (who also hails a taxi) and only a relatively small sign points to the bar, which you then reach by elevator from the lobby. And then? Wow, good music from various DJs (maybe a bit too loud, you still want to talk), nice people and good drinks of all kinds. We had a few drinks with friends, cocktails, draft beer, soft drinks and juices, everything was great. We were there for many hours and more than enjoyed it! The hamburgers are particularly worth mentioning and outstanding. You should be careful with superlatives, but these hamburgers are really world class! In addition, you sit or dance on a roof terrace with a great view of Saigon, the service is very friendly and quick and everything is affordable. You should definitely go! Crystal clear recommendation!",
      "Awesome vibes, excellent service, friendly vibe and top notch management. Emily will teach you card games, and has fantastic drink recommendations. The staff kept me company while I waited for my friends, ask them about the burgers, the menus, the after parties 🎉 Highly recommended."

      "We always aim for a Sunday Brunch in our travels. We were staying at the hotel so booked into the brunch here. Upon arrival we were met by an enthusiastic staff member who showed us to our table. Our brunch included free flow drinks. There was a choice of four cocktails but I asked if it was possible to have another one and it was not a problem. The beer and wine were cold and readily available if you wished. The food was great - oysters, crab, prawns, lobster, lamb, beef, fish, sushi, salads, dessert, cheeses - and the list goes on. It was an excellent choice of food and no shortage. The two staff members who looked after us were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. It is a great people watching venue. There was a real mixture of people - resident expats in groups, local couples enjoying a day out, groups of friends, mixed ages but all enjoying the afternoon. There was a DJ who played a good range of music. The only thing we didn't like was guys wearing singlets and flip flops. This is a fine dining restaurant. If there is one thing the hotel can do, it is to set and maintain a minimum standard and this should apply to dress. Apart from that, the brunch is worth a shot.",
      "I went here for dinner by myself and Lan Linh F&B server was sooo friendly and supportive taking so many beautiful photos for me as I was here by myself to enjoy. I enjoyed the dinner and the pretty photos of me that she took for me I’m very happy. Thanks Linh! I’ll be back again.",
      "I visited the social club on 6 Nov for my late dinner. An energetic young man Nhan Bui greeted me with a big smile and addressed me to a window seat with a very nice view. He is not only very knowledgeable on what they can offer and also have the patience to identify what s the best solution/food which I might need. What I observed is that he is a very hard working staff, he always serve and clean my table at the right time. I believe it required a very good attention on the customers. Every step he made can let you to feel his passion on serving customers. Overall, food quality met the expectation while the services far exceed. Special thanks to him and his team mates for their kind and responsive services. And most of your team members can speak fluent English. It is really a distinguished competitive edge in the market. 11月6日，我参观了社交俱乐部，吃了一顿很晚的晚餐。一个精力充沛的年轻人Nhan Bui微笑着迎接我，并把我对着一个可以看到美景的靠窗座位。他不仅非常了解他们可以提供什么，而且有耐心确定我可能需要的最佳解决方案/食物。我观察到的是，他是一个非常勤奋的员工，他总是在正确的时间服务和打扫我的桌子。我相信这需要非常关注客户。他迈出的每一步都能让你感受到他对为客户服务的热情。 总体而言，食品质量达到了预期，而服务远远超过预期。特别感谢他和他的队友们的友好和反应灵敏的服务。你的大多数团队成员都能说一口流利的英语。这确实是市场上一个突出的竞争优势。 强烈推荐。"

      "Today I went to meet a friend at Cafe Marcel. Stepping from a busy street I was instantly greeted by friendly staff and a relaxing environment. As it was my first time going there, the server politely explained both the food and drink menu and allowed me time to make my choices. I was promptly given my drink and without being rushed given a generous plate of food. The house made sausages had the perfect level of spice and my eggs were perfect for dipping the crunchy sourdough toast. All in all I can not recommend this place enough. Great addition to Saigon if you’re looking for a meeting point or delicious, fresh breakfast!",

The first time we went we were served by giang and the second time by phuong both were really lovely and helpful explaining the breakfast menu which is great value by the way. You can choose your eggs then your bread and sauce etc, they also have a really good brunch deal. The portions were really big and the food and iced coffee was so so good, would highly reccommend!",
      "This little cafe popped up in the search when we were looking for a flavorful meal on our last day in HCMC and it didn't disappoint. This is a tiny little cafe with seating on the first floor. Interiors are beautifully done and the staff is very courteous. Food items we had were Spicy Shakshuka, avocado tartine & iced phin coffee. Shakshuka wasn't very spicy, just the right amount for beautiful flavors. Avocado tartine was full of fresh avocado mash and cheese. And the coffee was just the right companion to top the entire meal. I would say it's the perfect place for breakfast/brunch. Prices are a little high as compared to other food options in the vicinity - but absolutely worth it..."

A special surprise was the clear vegetable soup we got unsolicited – a very nice gesture that reinforced the positive impression. 👨‍🍳 Service – 5 stars The service was exemplary! Our waiter from the team was extremely attentive and spoke very good English. Particularly positive: Not only did he give us expert recommendations, but he also repeated the order to make sure everything fits. That's what you'd like! 🧼 Cleanliness – 5 stars The restaurant was spotlessly clean – both the floor and tables were in perfect condition. Here you can see that great importance is attached to hygiene. 🚻 Toilets – 5 stars The toilets were modern and also extremely clean.

It was all amazing, the egg coffee was the best I’ve had by far, if you want to try it or love it already, you have to come here! The Vietnamese coffee was also excellent. The tuna sandwich was delicious and hearty, and came with a complimentary fruit pot. The mango yoghurt was so sweet and flavourful. All in all, amazing food and drinks! Nhien was such a lovely waitress, so kind and welcoming. There’s a nice view of the street, and upstairs is cosy and quiet. A perfect escape from the busy streets, with such a calm, lovely vibe. We could not recommend it enough here.",
      "I have been coming to HCMC for many years and Little HaNoi Egg Coffee restaurants are some of my favorite places to eat. There are a number of them and they all serve great food in a pleasant environment. Previously, my favorite was avocado egg toast, but since they added eggs benedict that has been my go to favorite. They have a whole page of different versions. I, of course, pair it with egg coffee. Potato wedges are optional and make a nice addition."

      "Ask for Jenny! Never been to Korean BBQ. Thought we would give it a go. Wonderful experience. We ordered the meal servicing 4-6 people, it would have easily fed 6. Great selection of vegetables, pork and beef cooked at your table. The meal came with a selection of sauces, quail eggs, broccoli, zucchini and other side dishes. This was followed with a delicious sweet and sour soup with beef and mushrooms. Food was fresh and delicious. Very reasonable priced. Wonderful service and experience.",

      "We found this restaurant on trip advisor and we're able to get a table on fairly short notice. The menu is some 60 pages long. We chose three chef special items to share and it was plenty of food for two. We also ordered two desserts. The presentation is impressive and everything tasted good. Prices are quite reasonable.",
      "My friends from the US were visiting Saigon for the first time - as they are vegetarian with sensitive stomachs and extremely wary of the tap water in Vietnam, I knew I had to bring them to this hidden gem in Thao Dien. In addition to the amazing and relaxing ambience, Laang has a great vegetarian option on its extensive menu. We ordered several dishes off the menu, including the stewed king oyster mushroom, grilled eggplant stuffed with shitake mushrooms, and stir-fried flat noodles with mixed mushrooms. Everything was delicious and my friends were very happy with the food. The pricing is extremely reasonable (6-15 USD / dish) given the ambience and service. If you visit, be sure to ask for Lukas who is the GM and he'll be sure to take care of you. He has deep experience working in F&B and originally worked in a Michelin rated restaurant in Europe. He's extremely knowledgeable about wines so can provide great recommendations if you're a newbie like me. Overall great restaurant with great service and great people. Couldn't recommend more highly.",
      "Nice restaurant with romance view, nice food and perfect service. I got 110% support from staff to setup a dinner for 19 people, 1 of our guest need to use Halal food and restaurant could support me to bringing the Halal food which delivered from another restaurant. I need to deposit 6 M VND for our dinner and could get it back from restaurant within 15hours, very high prestige. 5 stars and high recommended to visit."

They also served great French fries and delicious desserts like creme brûlée, creamy cheesecake with raspberry sauce and brownies. The place itself is very cute and inviting. The hostess and cashier girls were so welcoming and helpful they made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. My family and I ate here twice and If I lived in Ho Chi Minh, I would be a regular here.",

And this is a really good burger, the bread was one of the best I've tasted, although the meat could have been a little more seasoned. Fries were also very good and the homemade chili mayo that you get for free was the icing on the cake.",
      "Marcel the price of the cake combo includes 1 side dish and 1 water and the cheapest is about 220k, the price of the cake is about 180 in the picture, I ate 2 people with soft, delicious meat cake, the crust is very soft. But since it seems that people order a lot with the order of which one is to be grilled, the wait is a bit long. If you go hungry, you will cry :))"

      "The only best halal food in HCMC. The quality of food served is excellent and delicious and prepared with care. The owner is a dedicated man who obviously cares greatly for his business, his food and above all his customers. Halal food a novelty in HCMC and therefore the prices are higher understandably. However, having eaten at other neighboring restaurants, none satisfied me with the quality of their food as Daun did. Other restaurants were noisy, cluttered and served seriously bland food. I think what has happened is that since halal food in HCMC is rare, other outlets don't care about quality as much since the Muslim customers will be forced to go to these restaurants. Daun, on the other hand, is still dedicated to serving great food. For that I am truly grateful. Don't take my word for it. Feel free to compare yourselves.",
      "This halal & veg-friendly outlet is a delightful find💕 The menu is pretty extensive from Japanese to Western and South East Asian. We chose some healthy options - beef broth, French beans+egg, mushroom omelette & tumeric prawn (not on menu but a request that was graciously met). Mr Soffian, the owner, has a genuinely friendly personality with a passion for good service and great food. Wonderful hospitality! We got to try his egg coffee - a yummy concoction that seems like a dessert in a cup! If you’re after good friendly service and yummy food with something on the menu for a diverse group, you can’t go wrong with this eatery. Vert strongly recommended.",
      "Located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, Dau Restaurant offers a delightful blend of traditional Vietnamese cuisine and modern flair. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with a mix of rustic decor and contemporary touches that create a cozy yet stylish dining experience. The menu features a variety of dishes, but the standout for me was the pho, which was rich in flavor with perfectly tender beef. The fresh herbs and spices added a wonderful depth that truly showcased the essence of Vietnamese cooking. I also tried their summer rolls, which were light and refreshing, with a delightful peanut dipping sauce."

I also enjoyed the decor and the music created an intimate atmosphere that allowed our family to enjoy our time together without being intruded upon or intruding on others. My was an excellent waitress, ever solicitous of our enjoyment and comfort.",
      "Monday night is 50% off night and just as well as prices on the menu don’t include VAT or Service charge. Monday night is quite busy. The restaurant has a great ambiance. You get a great pate aperitif with lovely hot bread rolls. The beef is really good quality and tasty. We had one strip loin (a bit of fat rind but really good) and a tenderloin (like fillet, no fat). Cooked medium rare perfect. The wines are very expensive so went for the beer option. The water was the most expensive in Vietnam 140,000 plus tax plus service! It came from France… no idea why! So it came out as the most expensive meal so far in Vietnam - in spite of the 50% discount. But great meal, good quality and service."

The staff was so very friendly and showed us how to assemble our lunch with rice paper, lettuce, mint, basil, kimchi and the pork/shrimp pancake. The sauce (a mixture of the two provided...also demonstrated by one of our lovely servers) to dip in was so delicious I wanted to drink up the remains! I highly recommend this restaurant.",
      "Went by by by chance and were really pleasantly surprised. Fantastic food. Many authentic Vietnamese dishes to choose from. We chose a combo. Pork, rice, boiled cabbage, fish soup and some other things that I do not know the name of. Not spicy, but oh what flavors. A little noisy environment if you want to be a little fussy, but very good speed of serving. Can really be recommended and here we will gladly come again.",
      "Had a great experience at Bep Cuon Saigon! The crunchy banh xeo was absolutely delicious—light, crispy, and packed with flavor. The pork skewers were a highlight, too, perfectly seasoned and grilled just right.

Ordered a couple of beers to be going on with them our starters !! 1 starters each big mistake portion sizes are quite large, wife had the chicken tikka, I had onion pakora both were lovely and the touch of putting you first piece on your plate was quite nice, pakora were spicy and really nice best I’ve had for a while, tikka were lovely big pieces and so succulent. Then we had mains wife had keema mutta (probably spelt wrong) she said it was best she’s ever had just enough spice for her, I had chicken vindaloo, loads of chicken (loads of curry if I’m honest) not quite spicy enough for me usually have them a little hotter but very nice all the same. Portion sizes were quite large neither of us could finish our dishes ! I’d had a garlic naan wife had 2 chapatis not really nice, if we’re ever in HCMC again we shall definitely be back"

      "The Bún Chả tastes good. It is served with soft white vermicelli, mint leaves and other greens, two different fish sauces, and grilled marinated pork patties and bacon strips. What I love most is the Nem Cua Bể, crispy rolls with pork and crab meat. These are served on a griddle and go well with the Bún Chả. The only downside of this place is the tiny size of the restaurant. It can get rather uncomfortable when it is full of patrons. But I would recommend anyone who visits Ho Chi Minh City and would love to taste good Vietnamese food.",

Tracy the staff went above and beyond not just with the service but also when we asked about where to get mangosteen she researched where we could get some as the season for this fruit was over. After the children devoured the pizza we had to order another as it was so delicious! After leaving to go to the recommended spot for mangosteen, we realised we forgot our backpack and the manager/owner went out of his way to drop the bag to us! How kind! The staff are so lovely here and food is of high quality so if you ever fancy a pizza definitely would recommend this establishment! This will be somewhere we will definitely return to eat!",
      "We ordered salad, pasta, and pizza, and everything tasted amazing. Highly recommend the pesto pasta with chicken. Our server Rambo was always attentive and help us through out our ordering with excellent recommendations! He even suggested some nice places to visit during the night.",
      "Accommodating staff and tasty pizza. be mindful it’s a little pricier than the usual Vietnamese dinner prices. We paid 1,400000 VND for 4 pizzas and drinks for 3 adults and 3 kids. Air conditioning is worked well."

      "Wandering around bustling Ho Chi Minh City in search of a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner, we were intrigued by Rice Field , which is located right at the foot of the Bitexo Financial Tower on the opposite side , hard not to find! Original location all in wood with original Vietnamese details , we had dinner on the ground floor , very young waiters in traditional clothes quick and gentle , menu 'extensive at inline prices being recommended on the Michelin Guide . We ordered more dishes, almost all vegetarian, fantastic fried rolls, other fresh rolls of mixed vegetables, sautéed noodles with tofu and vegetables and fried calamari with vegetables, all great, well presented and hearty dishes, sauces and chilli served separately, however they ask for the degree of spiciness you want. Great idea to bring lettuce to wrap the fried rolls and not get your hands dirty! Really one of the best restaurants we stayed in our three weeks in Vietnam. Recommended! Only note, I would recommend more care in cleaning tables and in the bathroom.",
      "Delicious, lots of it. Good service. Central location but reasonable price with mid-range income, 2 people eat about 500k to be full. You should replace the chopsticks with new ones, the current chopsticks are moldy, reducing the customer experience",
      "I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant and I must say it was a truly exceptional dining experience. From the beginning, the welcoming and relaxing atmosphere made me feel at ease straight away. The dish that struck my palate the most was the fried calamari, crunchy and tasty, with a touch of freshness that made every bite a real pleasure. The fried garlic rice was equally delicious, packed with flavor and perfectly prepared. I can't help but mention the Michelin rice cake, which was truly a pleasant surprise: soft and tasty, demonstrating the chef's culinary skill. The service was impeccable, with friendly staff attentive to our needs. The background music helped create a pleasant atmosphere, without ever being intrusive. I highly recommend this restaurant to all lovers of good food and an authentic dining experience. If you're looking for delicious flavors and a welcoming environment, you can't go wrong with this place! I will definitely be back to try other delicacies on the menu. Five stars deserved!"

      "We checked the menu online and picked a location close to our hotel, and cancelled our original choice of a rooftop restaurant or bar, for our last night in Vietnam. The outlet we visited was packed to the gills and we then moved to this one. Despite being very very crowded with a one hour waiting, the staff at the earlier outlet were exceptionally helpful and courteous. Once we got to our new location, from the very beginning the staff was helpful in accommodating our booking change from 2 guests to 4 and gave us a table as soon as they could and tried to ensure we got seats whilst waiting. Every drink / dish we ordered turned out to be exceptional. The servers were very perceptive and understood our requirements and ensured that they clarified about allergens, and to the extent of limitations we may have about other ingredients. It shows the training and culture of the Brand. They also took pains to clarify that some dishes would not suit us or apologise for being sold out! The (very common) Mojito, or the Sangrias or even the Whey cider were exceptional to say the least. The cheese platters with the toasted breads, the pizza, the desserts (esp the terrine) were fantastic Personally, I found it refreshing and surprising that a chain with outlets across countries and cities, was able to rise above mass production and yet retain flavour, presentation as also service. Highly recommend this to all visitors to Vietnam (and elsewhere), and especially to vegetarians / vegans for the choices.",
      "This establishment offers exceptional value for your money, providing not only affordable prices but also delivering high-quality and satisfying meals. The service is not only efficient but also friendly, creating a welcoming atmosphere that enhances the overall dining experience. With such a positive experience, I can confidently say that I will eagerly return to enjoy the delicious food and hospitality once again.",
      "PIZZA 4P’S, a real hidden gem located in district 1 in ‘mini Japan town’. We were completely blown away by the fresh ingredients that you could clearly taste/sense were fresh! Organic, sustainable, local + homemade cheese, reasonable prices for the quality and sweet/proffesional staff, just a very good experience. Don’t be fooled by the name, there’s much more than just pizza on the menu."

      "Great food at a good price was very happy with what we received. Wife had the Crab omelet with garlic fried rice and I had the 2 sausages with onion rings and oyster mushrooms as a side. 10/10 reminded me of good pub food from home.",
      "I really enjoyed this place. I am a lightweight and I am always looking for a beer with less alcohol and have the ability to order in a small glass instead of a pint or something huge and this place hit all of the dots. It also had probably the best tasting, very low alcohol beer I have ever had - chanh muoi ale (salted lime). Thinking about this place too much and will go back when I am in Saigon again! :)",
      "I did not expect to find ‘real’ craft beer in Vietnam. I am so pleasantly surprised. I got a flight; I had the Irish Stout, Jasmine Red, Session IPA, Pomello IPA, Double Jasmine IPA, and the special Stout (I forget the exact name; it’s an extra charge) It was super delicious! Cherry and chocolate notes. Yum! I had the Pasteur Street hamburger which comes with fries. It was delicious. My wife had the Omelette with crab and rice and it was delicious as well. It was also delicious. We had the fried ground duck with rice crackers and the onion rings for an appetizer. I recommend both. The service was impeccabile. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us order food. Everything is in English so there was no problem ordering. My wife does not like spicy foods, so the waiter made sure nothing was spicy, and brought me some Tabasco to spice up my food. I HIGHLY recommend eating here if you’re in the area. There is a bit of variety in the menu, so you’re not limited to one or two choices. Again, if you like craft beer definitely stop by here … and take a flight!"

      "I stumbled upon Hoang’s Kitchen and it turned out to be one of my favorite food spots in the city! I ordered the fresh rolls and the incredibly soft grilled pork with quail eggs — both recommended by Bear, one of the friendliest and most helpful staff I’ve met on my trip. The flavors were bold, fresh, and perfectly balanced. The grilled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and paired with the quail eggs, it hit all the right notes. Bear really went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience — from helping with the order to making great suggestions. It’s the kind of place that feels warm, local, and authentic. Highly recommend if you’re in Saigon and craving something genuinely good and comforting!"

From the moment we entered, the friendly and attentive staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Upon being seated we were served a refreshing starter of cool juice along with wet towelettes to freshen up and clear the dust from our journey through the busy Saigon streets. The menu was extensive and the prices were surprisingly low compared to other restaurants in District 1. Our dishes were served quickly and the food was excellent. My wife and I were discussing whether we could possibly make room for a light dessert when to our delighted surprise our waiter appeared with two small dishes of delicious cubed fruit which was provided free of charge as if they had read our minds. A perfect finish to a wonderful evening out. We will absolutely be returning to enjoy more of the wonderful food, superb, friendly service, and joyful atmosphere provided.

One of the best restaurants we’ve been to in vietnam. They also give you some free crisps/dips at the start of your meal and a free shot at the end of the meal!",
      "The first time I went to La Fiesta I didn't really do the food justice as I was on a diet and so only ate the chicken salad. But the salad was refreshing and the dressing was enjoyable. The chicken was very more-ish too. And the frozen jalapeno Margarita was one of the best, most enjoyable Margaritas tasted anywhere. The next two times I had a delivery of chili con carne which came with french fries, so I made my own basmati rice to go with the chili as rice is my preference and also enjoyed the shoestring fries. I had a side of salad too which was just as fresh and tasty as I remembered. The chili con carne was too much on the mild side for me, although still a delicious flavour, but a couple of sliced red chilis added to the chili soon remedied that and brought it up to the level of spiciness I'm used to. The whole experience was very satisfying and I.m now looking forward to trying many of the other dishes at La Fiesta as well.",

      "This is a lovely relaxed coffee shop that sits above the hustle and bustle of district 1. The cafe is very atmospheric with comfortable indoor seating or section of bar seating on the balcony. Of the coffee options there were clear vegan options (oat milk/coconut). While obviously a little more expensive than more local places, this is still reasonably priced at less than £2 for a coconut coffee with coconut flakes and a complimentary cold tea on arrival. The cafe is above a restaurant, there is a sign for it, and to the left of the sign is a doorway leading to a corridor, at the end of this corridor you go up the steps to level 2. The steps are a decent size and have railing so suitable for anyone who can climb stairs mobility wise.",
      "In April 2024 I visited Vietnam with my son. While we were there, like so many other tourists and locals alike, we both fell in love with Vietnamese coffee and sought out various coffee shops across the country to try their version of the national drink. Tonkin Coffee in HCMC offered some of the absolute best coffee we had during our 3-week stay in Vietnam. We tried out their milk and egg coffees – both were delicious, so much so that we ordered a second coffee while we were there. As we were also hungry when we got to the coffee shop, we had some of their pastries and banh mi. Both were excellent! I should also mention the outstanding friendly service at the café as well. This literal hole in the wall café is located down a long alley hallway and up a flight of stairs, but it is well worth seeking out. I highly recommend this wonderful little coffee shop!",
      "A true hidden gem in Saigon! We nearly walked past it as the entrance is just a doorway, but we’re glad we found it! We both had the Tonkin version of a Vietnamese coffee (mine was iced, my husband went for hot). We also had a custard-filled croissant each which were absolutely lovely! The atmosphere was calm and the staff lovely. Get yourself in!"

      "Tucked away in a smaller alley in Ward 6, District 3 in Ho Chi Minh is this unique restaurant. I had seen online when home in Australia then when in Ho Chi Minh went a few days earlier to make arrangements re: specifics of what I wanted and paid deposit. On arrival all looked as expected. We were given menu immediately and needed to make selections for the night as 4 of the 5 courses had choices ! Easy enough . Had to ask for drinks menu and placed our orders and then courses started to arrive . The cake and happy birthday song came out after the first course. After having our final bite of our 3rd course the assistant waiter had our main course signalling the main waiter to take our current plate away to put main course plate down. We then had to ask as our cocktail was finished could he now get us our bottle of wine we had ordered as would obviously like to enjoy with the main course. Pace seemed very rushed . I had to use google translate to get this message across . This being said food was very nice . Ambience very was lovely . I would definitely recommend for a special occasion. It was also in mine opinion excellent value for money . The waiter was very attentive to all requests when asked and a great picture taker for all different couples , groups celebrating an event that evening Just please don’t rush the food.",
      "Service was perfection as well as the food We were amazed with the foie gras and the angus beef was cooked at the or its best The fish with its crusted top was very good Desserts are ok but not the restaurant best I would not recommend espresso as it was a simple shot of black coffee and not a real espresso"

      "Thank you very much for giving me the chance to talk about my favourite restaurant. The name of my favourite restaurant is Mayonaka and it’s situated in the centre place of the city (175 De Tham street , Pham ngu lao ward, District 1. I like the spacious, serene environment, serves and tasty food. It is a two storeyed restaurant 2nd floor is reserved for different parties or special events. The room is large and The restaurant offers several dishes including exotic desserts, sashimi , sushi, ice-creams the food is more than great) The prices are reasonable and the foods are served quickly and discount for regular customers are two other reasons I like it more than other restaurants in Ho Chi Minh city",
      "If you are looking for sushi at the very highest level in Ho Chi Minh City, you cannot avoid this address. The fish is simply extra class and even Wagyu fillet is served to Fine Dining Fans - and all at a price that is more than just reasonable, because in Europe a dinner in a Japanese restaurant of this class would be good and happy to cost three times as much and then probably not nearly as perfect! Just a big praise to the service and the kitchen! However, since the restaurant is not too big, it is definitely worth the Reservation in advance."

The restaurant served amazing food which was open until 10pm so after our drinks on the sky bar we went to the restaurant to eat. Fabulous 👌 we will return ♥️",
      "Bunbonambo is a good restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but the service is good and the view is good. The lemon lassi is delicious and everything is good, but you have to ask for water separately. I guess they charge extra for water. I asked for a lot of cilantro, and they gave me a generous amount. I was very satisfied with this.",
      "I feel like the restaurant misses the spotlight due to the excellent bar on the roof.... I am a guest at Aira Hotel and usually I avoid hotel restaurants as they are more then usually pretty average. But tonight due to the unfortunate situation of being hit by a motorcycle crossing the road I decided to try the restaurant, rather than go out and risk being run over again... OMG this restaurant is amazing. The staff are so attentive and really care how you are doing, explaining the best way to enjoy each dish, and offer suggestions throughout the evening. But the food is incredible. I went for a set menu, which comes with three courses and a glass of wine. Each course was bursting with flavour and was a joy to eat. The meal was the perfect size leaving me very satisfied at the end. Perfect time to hit the sky Bar and Lounge and enjoy an Espresso Martini!"

      "Super friendly and cozy restaurant with locals and tourists. The staff is very nice. Zin Zin was the one who served me and he taught me how to eat the Vietnamese pancake. Also had shrimp with coconut and rice yogurt for dessert. All very delicious. There’s an 8% tax added to the prices and if you pay with card an extra 3%",
      "Very friendly staff, and could speak decent English. Helped me to pick the right amount of food and showed me photos of what I was ordering. The menu was also in English. Delicious food, and fair prices.",
      "We were impressed by the excellent dining experience at this restaurant. We tried the Vietnamese spring rolls, crispy on the outside, bitten down to make a slight crunch, and the filling was very fresh, full of vegetable aromas and meaty, layered taste. The service was also impeccable, the staff were very warm, friendly, always smiling, attentively answered all our questions and made us feel at home. In addition, the restaurant's environment is comfortable and welcoming, with chic and Vietnamese decor, perfect for parties, family dinners or a drink with friends. Enjoying food in such an environment is such an enjoyable experience that we look forward to coming back again!"

      "We came to the restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and were very happy with how we were treated. The food was a little expensive in my opinion but given how amazing the customer service was, we feel like itâ€™s justified. Definitely will be recommending our friends here",
      "Our favorite rooftop bar for the combination of a group of professional bartenders, range of drinks and great waiters. Outside seating was very comfortable (not the high seating) and service was constant and efficient. I think we came here 3 times. The happy hour is good value. They even gave my partner a wrap when it got cold. That wrap was clean and did the job. The lighted signs make this place attractive. The prices on the regular menu are high but the non happy hour cocktail (Le vie en rose) was very tasty. We had the canapÃ© plate and we thought it was on the small side which is our only complaint. All in all a lovely spot to chill and yes meet some nice people.",
      "This is a beautiful roof top bar with an amazing view and such an excellent service. Liam was kind enough to take some nice pictures of us and helped us select our drinks, the drinks are potent and delicious. The food was good and the vibe is amazing :) youâ€™re greeted with such warmth that you feel like staying here! Highly recommended. Itâ€™s cold so wear accordingly."

A staff member named Pam complimented the menu, everything was delicious and she was really friendly. I especially recommend the eel dish. It's eaten like Vietnamese spring rolls, but it's delicious. The grilled squid is okay, but the sauce is really unique, but it's delicious. It goes well together. Even my dad, who doesn't like the unique leafy flavor, enjoyed it."

The servings were appropriately sized, not huge American portions. The hot pate and compound butter served with the bread basket was a nice touch. We had the sea bass and seafood squid-ink pasta, both were very good. We will probably try it again before going home.

      "I had the pleasure of dining at Quan Que during my recent trip to Vietnam, and it was an experience I won't forget. Located in a charming part of town, this restaurant offers a perfect blend of traditional Vietnamese flavors and a cozy, inviting atmosphere. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure our every need was met without being overbearing. The restaurant itself has a rustic, authentic feel, with wooden tables, lanterns, and beautiful decor that captures the essence of Vietnamese culture. As for the food, it was absolutely outstanding. We started with the Goi Cuon (fresh spring rolls) and Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancakes), both of which were bursting with flavor and made with the freshest ingredients. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Pho – a warm, aromatic bowl of noodles with a rich broth that had been simmering for hours. The balance of herbs, meat, and broth was perfect!",
      "Came here tonight with some friends I’m travelling with and was served by Henry who was so sweet and had amazing service! Spent 210.000VND on a drink and main meal (just over $8), which is amazing value for the deliciously large portion of pineapple fried rice I enjoyed. Thank you Henry for giving us great recommendations- my friends really enjoyed the beef pancake dish which was showed to us how to properly eat it. I was so jealous, it looked so good! Overall great place for all demographics :)"

      "This place has a really nice atmosphere and a light, accessible menu for when you feel like a break the deep-fried delights of Hanoi. We had two salted coffees, an americano, an avocado smoothie, peanut butter sourdough toast and a fruit salad breakfast bowl for 10 GBP. Itâ€™s also right next to the home of the original Hanoi egg coffee.",
      "A cute little spot with an upstairs air conditioned room if you need to escape the Hanoi heat, or a perfect people watching covered alley if you need to shelter from the rain. I visited twice during my visit to Hanoi, warmly welcomed and served by Chi on my second visit. The biggest draw for me was the Italian style coffee offerings (excellent latte) as a break from Vietnamese filter coffee. For those alternative milk hunters, oat milk is on offer. I also enjoyed the oat bowl (which again I think was made with a non-dairy milk). Whilst pricier than local-style coffee/breakfast offerings it was worth it.",
      "Egg coffee is not what you may imagine. It was invented at the 5-star iconic Metropole Hotel in Hanoi when the French wanted a cappuccino and there was no milk. So, frothed egg whites, then frothed eggs, and finally frothed egg yolks were added to make a drink tasting like the best-ever tiramisu. This cafÃ© has been confirmed to be the #1 choice for the best egg coffee ever. I agree!"

      "We were looking for a place to chill out for about six hours until we caught a sleeper bus out of the city and we came across what turned out to be a little gem of a roof top pool bar which Included lockers and shower facilities . The bar is very smartly laid out with a cool design throughout and the seating is very comfortable. The food was absolutely gorgeous and the presentation was fit for the king of England himself ! Specifically, we had the duck, spring rolls, vegetable salad, pumpkin soup and crab fish cakes. The bar itself is great with a wide variety of drinks ! And finally, but certainly not least the bar staff themselves are very warm, welcoming and accommodating which made the whole experience what it was. which when I reflect on my experience at the bar it was simply outstanding and I hope to return or the very least I will recommend my friends and family that come to Hanoi to go and see how great it is for themselves. Big shout out to the bar staff particularly Sang, Vu, Dylan that made it so welcoming.",
      "Staying in the hotel we had an afternoon at the Sky Lounge we enjoyed relaxing by the pool then day into evening had a few drinks and asked the lovely Chien could we eat from the dinner menu? Chien was so attentive and gave us a 5 star service with drinks and dinner. Nothing was too much trouble. A nice casual afternoon evening with amazing Mussels and wine, the largest I’ve ever had! Chien made our experience the best, such a friendly great English speaking member of staff!",
      "Excellent night! We had an incredible time! We will listen to the DJ again and have shots with Fiu, our waiter who treated us very well. If you come to Vietnam, spend a few hours at night having a few drinks and listening to music, highly recommended!!!"

Note that this restaurant is a bit more expensive than most restaurants in Hanoi, we got 6€ per person but it was really worth the cost. I recommend!!",
      "Friendly and fast service. Fantastic Vietnamese food- rice paper spring rolls two different kinds of vegetarian with respective tofu and fried fish in with vegetables and delicious fresh herbs, soy dressing etc- the waiter showed us how, we had to fold them and they tasted heavenly. Clean and neat inside and outside a small terrace with rice paper lamps with light in one could also enjoy the view to the inside- on 1. Sal. Can highly recommend and almost a must",
      "This place has lots of delicious gluten-free options, I was a pleasure to eat their Rice fried and their mango salad. Nice waiters and very knowledgeable about gluten-free, speak very good English, which made it really easy to explain my needs. They made me feel safe! ;) Present so many vegetable dishes, which we really enjoyed. Beautiful discovery, BRAVI!!!! ❤️❤️❤️💛💛🪷🪷🪷🪷"

      "This cafe serves some delicious and affordable options for breakfast and brunch. This morning I tried their dragon fruit smoothie bowl, which was priced just at $3.50. The bowl was full of vibrant colors and flavors - the smooth dragonfruit puree was topped with crunchy granola, fresh fruit like mango and banana. It made for a healthy start to the day. This also has a relaxing, cozy ambiance and the service was friendly. Besides the smoothie bowl, they offer a range of coffee drinks, pastries, and other breakfast about $3 to $6. Overall, it's a nice spot to grab a quick but quality meal without breaking the bank. I'd recommend giving the smoothie bowl a try if you're in the area.",

      "Incredible experience. Staff is knowledgeable about food, wine and general hospitality and provides personalised service. 10/10 would recommend the indulgence menu, great quality for a reasonable price, and premium, tasty dishes.",
      "We attended this outstanding establishment in September 2024. My partner and I had planned to elope in Sapa with our parents, however Typhoon Yagi had other plans for us and we instead got married in a forest outside of Hanoi. Scrambling for a place to celebrate our nuptials we emailed several restaurants including the French Grill. From our initial correspondence with the helpful Assistant Manager Ms Nga Nguyen onwards, our experience was nothing less than magical. Ms Nga Nguyen was completely sympathetic of our change in wedding plans and the entire team at the French Grill went out of their way to make our evening as seamless and special possible, including arranging a beautiful flower arrangement for our table even though the restaurant does not typically use flowers as part of their décor. We secured the Burgundy Room, a semi-private dining area that suited our needs perfectly. One of our party is vegetarian and had a delectable six course dining experience which was delivered and explained with as much care and thoughtfulness as the Indulgence Menu, chosen by the rest of us. We were served by the knowledgeable and charming Kian who was respectful of our need for privacy but equally seemed to be able to anticipate our every need and answer our every query with professionalism, grace and consideration, and even managed to delight and surprise us multiple times during the evening with his thoughtfulness. Kian, we wish you all the best with your career as a sommelier and have no doubt that you will be successful in all that you aspire to do. On to the food. Frankly, I was concerned that our parents would feel out of place and ill at ease with \"fancy French food\" that was completely unfamiliar to them. I need not have worried. My 79 year father has told us (and everyone he knows) repeatedly that the meal he had at the French Grill was the best he has had in his life and easily the highlight of his 2024 (even more so than presiding over our marriage ceremony in a the forest which was pretty spectacular). The Snow Crab was a real favourite on the table and each plate appeared more stunning and show-stopping than the dish before. There is a chocolatier on site and although we were all stuffed to the gills by the end of the night, the team brought us a selection of goodies as a parting gift and we all seemed to be able to make room for the deliciousness that followed - we cannot recommend trying the chocolate strongly enough. A huge thanks to the entire kitchen staff at the French Grill for a meal of a lifetime, unfortunately we did not have the foresight to ask for any names for our review (which we did not really intend to write as we never do, but thought the French Grill deserves all the public gratitude it can get). Overall, our night at the French Grill was so incredibly memorable and perfect. Budding photographer Nga Nguyen took some lovely photographs of our group and called us a taxi as we sadly said goodbye; she made us feel truly cared from from start to finish. We must thank mother nature for changing our destiny as we would not have had the pleasure at dining at this truly special establishment if our wedding had gone ahead as we had planned.",
      "We enjoyed a family celebration at the French grill and absolutely loved it. The hostess, manager, waitresses and bartender were all amazing, bringing a small cake while singing happy birthday and making fun special mocktails for the table. The filets were ridiculous and the kids loved the lobster bisque and fresh bread with various butters! Thanks for a memorable night during our stay at the JW Marriott!"

This was also the only restaurant in our entire Vietnam trip to charge an additional 8% VAT so we ended up paying 455,000 VND in total. Note also this restaurant only takes cash. I also felt that we were short served as we ordered two serves of cha ca which came out in a single pan but we would be lucky to have 5 small pieces of fish each (can barely see the fish under the veges). However, the meal itself was very tasty. So overall I feel that this place takes advantage of tourists especially if you can't speak Vietnamese.",

      "If you're in Hanoi and looking to indulge in one of the city's most iconic dishes, Chả Cá Thăng Long is a must-visit! This cozy, family-owned restaurant specializes in Chả Cá, a traditional Vietnamese dish featuring grilled fish served with fresh herbs, peanuts, and rice noodles. From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted by the sizzling aroma of fish being grilled right in front of you. The fish is tender, slightly crispy on the outside, and beautifully flavored with turmeric and dill, creating the perfect balance of taste. It’s served with a variety of fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and peanuts to add crunch and freshness to each bite. The portion size is generous, making it a great value for the price. The staff is friendly and quick, adding to the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the restaurant. If you’re in the mood for an authentic taste of Hanoi, Chả Cá Thăng Long won’t disappoint. It’s a quintessential Vietnamese experience that lives up to its reputation and then some!",
      "Nice restaurant in the historic center of Hanoi, with tables outside and inside. As soon as we arrived it was very crowded but (even though we had a reservation) we were able to sit immediately on the first floor. The staff did not speak English very well, they presented us with the (basic) menu, asking us if we agreed to order 2 sets of menus. Without really understanding what they included, we took the plunge and asked for spring rolls too. The setting was immediately prepared for us, with different sauces, herbs and noodles to accompany the main course, which was served in a convivial pan placed in the center of the table, on a small stove used to complete the dish at the table. We were also shown how to compose the dish (lightly breaded fish fillets, with dill and other vegetables) using the ingredients previously brought to the table. All very pleasant and light, the spring rolls served separately were simply fabulous!! Extremely appropriate and low bill compared to European standards (€18 for two with drinks, water and Pepsi). Ideal for a taste of Vietnamese cuisine in an authentic, no-frills venue. For a quick meal! Advised!"

      "We heard that Don Duck 2 in the old quarter was highly recommended and had their version of a Michelin star so we went there with high expectations, and we were not disappointed. Whilst the restaurant is small and on multiple levels it is best to book your table before arriving as even in the early evening the restaurant was packed. As the name suggests it specialises in duck based dishes but does still cater for those who wish to dine on something else. As a lover of duck dishes I tried their Duck spring rolls and was blown away at how good they were followed by Grilled duck on the table whilst N chose a chicken dish with rice which she thoroughly enjoyed. Finally whilst the food and service was exceptional the cost was significantly lower than one would expect from a Michelin star restaurant with main, (duck), courses starting from as little as 155,000dong.",
      "Going off google reviews we found Don Duck… wasn’t disappointed.. good to see a restaurant specialising in one product and doing it 100%. Small aircon eating area downstairs, more seating upstairs. Staff were exceptional. Drinks cold and well priced - due to being busy they have us complimentary spring rolls while we waited. It was only a 10 min wait.",
      "Our family had the pleasure of dining at Don Duck Old Quarter Restaurant in Vietnam, and it was an experience to remember! We ordered a variety of dishes including the Crispy Duck Spring, 1 1/4 Roasted Duck, Stir Fried Chicken, Vietnamese Beef Steak, and Seafood Fried Rice. Each dish was fantastic, bursting with authentic flavors and cooked to perfection.The Roasted Duck, in particular, was a standout—tender, juicy, and wonderfully seasoned. The Crispy Duck Spring was a delightful start to our meal, and the Vietnamese Beef Steak was a delicious twist on a classic. The Stir Fried Chicken and Seafood Fried Rice were also excellent, perfectly complementing the rich flavors of the duck dishes.Our meal was accompanied by refreshing drinks: Watermelon Juice, Lemon Juice, Coke, Orange Juice, and Lavie Water, which paired well with the food and added to the overall enjoyment of our lunch.The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, making it a great spot for a family meal. The staff were attentive and provided excellent service throughout our visit.We highly recommend Don Duck Old Quarter Restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy authentic and delicious Vietnamese cuisine. It’s a must-visit if you’re in the area!"

      "L’essence de cuisine is a good spot to go for dinner, but I’m not sure it deserves to be ranked as one of the best in Hanoi. I don't specifically have anything bad to say - the food just didn’t blow me away. The service was very good, the ambience was nice and the presentation of each dish was carefully thought out. However, I don’t believe it should be ranked in the top 5 of the city. I did not feel that the food on the couples tasting menu was that memorable or flavourful enough to justify the price. It was definitely tasty, but not super unique. They are always looking to improve so I’m sure that this restaurant can work it’s way up to be a top location in Hanoi.",
      "Had a wonderful dinner at L’essence de la Via Cuisine. The food was absolutely delicious — every dish full of flavour and beautifully presented. The cocktails were expertly made and really added to the experience. What stood out most was the exceptional service — the waiting staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel so welcome throughout the evening. Highly recommend this place for a special night out. Top marks all around!",
      "On our last evening in Vietnam we went to eat at this place, hoping to end on a high note. Instead, despite the pleasant environment, we ate poorly, in fact we almost didn't eat, because after the first tastes we didn't like the food. Unfortunately, our evening was ruined, because we had no alternatives for that evening, we didn't trust ourselves to go, at a late hour, to another random restaurant in the center of Hanoi, and so we were left disappointed and fasting. My husband gave it a negative review. This fact and this unpleasant situation cannot be erased. However, after a few days, when we had already returned home to Italy, the owner, not present on the evening of dinner, refunded us the bill paid, after having been asked, through the email with which we had booked, for the data banking. Making mistakes in the kitchen, or in the dining room, can sometimes happen, and it has already happened even in the best restaurants. Fully refund the amount paid, days later and 13,000 km later. It had never happened to me before. Compliments. It seems right to me to also review this correct behavior."

      "We had a wonderful experience at The Rhythms (33–34 Hàng Dầu, Hanoi) celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary. The restaurant thoughtfully decorated our table and provided very attentive service, making our special day even more memorable. Prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was cozy with a perfect amount of space between tables, ensuring privacy and comfort. Special thanks to Hằng (Katie), who was extremely dedicated and caring throughout the evening. She made sure everything was perfect for us. The food was delicious, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. We highly recommend The Rhythms to couples and families looking for a lovely place to dine and celebrate special moments!",
      "It's like going for dinner on the last day of our trip to Hanoi. I ordered a Vietnamese course and steak here. The course meal was more delicious than expected and the portion was sufficient. The steak I ordered was served after the course meal and before dessert. Perhaps because I was full after the course meal, the steak was not as tasty as I expected. There was little Maillard on the surface of the meat. I especially ordered T-bone, but the tenderloin was so small that I thought it was l-bone. The steak was cooked the way I wanted it to be, but it was a little disappointing, but I enjoyed it. Dessert wasn't that great. I think it would be better not to eat it. The server in charge of us treated us kindly, which left us with a good memory. I would like to visit again next time if I have the chance."

      "We stopped into The Hudson Rooms at the top of the Capella Hotel for drinks and a snack before dinner at Backstage. The top floor space is gorgeous as is the rest of the hotel. It is reminiscent of top floor lounges in Hong Kong. Service is sophisticated and high end. Our shrimp cocktail was five tiny shrimp for a healthy amount of money, but I expect to pay for such a swanky bar. Drinks were fine and equally as expensive. The Hudson Rooms is a special place in Hanoi. It is worth the cost for that extraordinary setting."

Drank a cold beer for 30,000. The staff is super friendly and will be happy to change the menu if you have an allergy to something or you just don't want it. For example Cilantro. The restaurant is larger than it can be seen from the road, there are several tables in the room at the back. Definitely worth a visit.",

      "We visited Luk Lak Restaurant in Hanoi after seeing it recommended in the Michelin Guide with a Bib Gourmand distinction. The location is convenient, right near the Opera House, and the restaurant itself is spread across three nicely decorated floors, creating a pleasant and welcoming ambiance. The menu offered an impressive range of dishes, with photos and detailed English descriptions to make ordering easy. The staff were lovely—very friendly and attentive, adding to the positive atmosphere. For our meal, we chose the following: • Cua Lột Sốt Me Cuốn Bánh Tráng: Deep-fried soft-shell crab wrapped in rice paper with fresh herbs and seasonal vegetables, served with tamarind sauce. • Gà Nướng Tú Lệ: Grilled chicken with lime leaves, accompanied by sticky rice from Tu Le and special house-made sauces. • Vịt Cháy Tỏi: Pan-seared boneless duck with garlic from Ly Son, Thai basil, and pickled bamboo shoots. The portions were generous, and the presentation was good. However, the flavours didn’t quite meet our expectations. The lime leaves in the grilled chicken were almost imperceptible, and while the duck dish was better, it wasn’t particularly memorable. Overall, we were a bit underwhelmed given the restaurant’s reputation. It’s worth a visit for the ambiance and service, but the food might not leave a lasting impression. (Also posted to my food blog on Instagram @AbbeyKing16)",
      "Luk Lak is a clear step above the average local restaurant without being significantly more expense. We enjoyed it so much the first time we dined there that we came back a couple of nights later. The room is well presented with a reasonable amount of space between the tables and we found the food delicious.",
      "The restaurant spans three colonial-style floors, each exuding a nostalgic Indochine charm. The first floor houses a cozy café, while the upper levels provide spacious dining areas adorned with custom paintings celebrating Vietnamese heritage. Guided by Chef Madame Binh, who brings over 25 years of experience from Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi, the menu is a testament to Vietnam's rich culinary diversity. Dishes are crafted using regionally sourced ingredients, ensuring both authenticity and freshness. As Asians we enjoyed the restaurant so much that we returned the next day. Highly recommend the Stuffed Pigeon with Sticky Rice, where tender pigeon meat is combined with sticky rice, wrapped in lotus leaves, and grilled with five-spice seasoning, resulting in a flavorful and aromatic dish. The Nem Lụi Huế was also good. The Nem Ốc Hà Nội must have been unqiue but we took the soft-shelled crab spring rolls instead. I believe they have the dồi huyế, blood sausage but we were already too stuffed. The Restaurant offers an impressive wine list that rivals those of many top-tier establishments, yet at more accessible prices. Their selection encompasses a variety of sparkling, white, rosé, and red wines. I found some not so big names ones like Damilano Barbera d'Asti DOCG which i definitely recommend with the meats."

      "A must visit place for the view after sunset. The place is on the 67th floor with an open roof. You can go to the 67th floor after touring the sky observatory deck. However once you’ve gone to the top of Hanoi you aren’t allowed to come back down to the sky observatory. Really loved the Vietnamese techno being played there. The live music band is also good and playing a lot of jazz versions.",
      "Very special place with a beautiful view of the city of Hanoi. You can have dinner at the Poano restaurant downstairs and then you can go to the terrace to have a drink and see Hanoi from above. Expensive restaurant but the food is good. Drinks on the terrace at prices from 6 to 10 euros. Recommended"

      "What a fantastic experience at Hanoi Fusion. The food was absolutely beautiful and the service from Zo was exceptional. The restaurant itself is so inviting and perfectly laid out even with dining on a mezzanine floor. The prices were very good with a family of 4 having a huge feast and two rounds of drinks at a very low price. I cannot forget to mention the Hanoi special smoothie oh so good! We will definitely come back when we return to Hanoi in a few days. We are so pleased our Tour Guide Quan mentioned this restaurant to us.",
      "We had a lovely meal at Hanoi Fusion! We tried the seafood pasta and the tenderloin steak—both were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. The seafood was fresh and the steak was cooked to perfection. While the space itself is a bit small, the restaurant is spread across three floors. If you're willing to climb a few stairs, the top floor is definitely worth it. It offers a charming open-air dining experience with a great view of the street below, adding to the overall vibe. Highly recommend for a cozy yet flavorful dining experience in Hanoi! Would you like it written in a more casual or humorous tone?",
      "We came here through a friend's recommendation, the food and drinks here are very delicious and the prices are reasonable. The cozy space is very suitable for those who like quiet, the staff is friendly, enthusiastic and cheerful. We will definitely come back."

      "My husband and I passed by this unassuming restaurant in a small back street and decided to stop in for dinner. I can not emphasize enough how incredible our meal was. We ordered duck leg noodle soup and fried rice with duck leg and an egg. The noodles were firm and chewy as home made noodles should be. The broth was complex with a depth of flavour that can only be achieved from hours of simmering. And the duck was tender and delicious. The sauce on the duck leg combined with the fried rice and the jammy egg made each bite perfection. We will definitely be back again. This is one restaurant not to be missed.",
      "Best food I’ve had in Hà Nội! Tucked down a cosy alley near the cathedral, this place is a real find. The food looked gorgeous and was delicious, with all the condiments you’d expect on the table if, like me, you want to ramp up the chilli as you eat… Friendly staff, easy ordering, great prices, and the music was brilliant, too. Perfect lunch!",
      "Great food with affordable price. We tried the noodles and dimsum as well, both are fresh, rightly flavored. The service was 10/10 i believe, the servers were gentle, responsive. The location is easy to reach, right in the heart of the Old Quaters, definitely recommend this place for both local people and tourists"

They have Omakase, Teppanyaki, A la carte as well. Our bill was $100 for 2 people (we order a la carte) including drink and we were super happy with such a beautiful experience. Service here they follow Forbes Standards and this is the only standalone restaurant in Vietnam is doing so (What the manager shared with us). I have a look at Lunch menu and prices are even more attractive, $11 for a lunch set as I remember, definitely need to come and try next time.",

      "It was a great experience! The price was 50 USD for two people, including one bamboo snake and drinks (including alcohol). The owner, Dragon, was friendly and very charming. We were able to talk a lot about the restaurant and the food. Because it was a weekday, we were able to talk a lot with Dragon, so I recommend visiting on a weekday when it is not crowded with other customers!! First, you are asked to choose between a bamboo snake or a cobra (which is a little more expensive). Next, if you want, you can see the moment the snake is killed. You can also choose whether to drink the heart and blood. After that, you order a drink, and the dishes made with the snake you just killed are brought out one after another. … The taste is excellent. Depending on the cooking method, it tasted like chicken, fish, or eel white meat, so it was fun. By the way, Dragon likes dirty jokes. The serve is humorous and the atmosphere is somewhat mysterious. There is no other restaurant as wonderful as this! Eccentric!",
      "An incredible experience. It is a little far from the center but it is worth experiencing. Mr. Dragon's treatment is unbeatable. He is always joking so that you have a good time but at the same time you can talk seriously with him. They have a Bamboo Snake or a King Cobra (the first one is cheaper than the second one). We opted for the first option and for the price we agreed upon, they served us the snake in 7 different ways (all of them delicious) and all the drinks we wanted. 100% recommended if you are in Hanoi, we loved it.",
      "family reastaurant. kind workers. the owner (dragon) was very kind to show me the snakes served in the restaurant. if you come alone give a call to the owner to check if there is a dead snake already, otherwise, you need to pay for a whole one. great place to come with friends and great snake dishes!"

      "Very nice ambience, cozy lighting. Charcoal barbecue at the table is awesome. We had the Wagyu set (USA) for two people (3*130 gr) and additionally ordered an Angus Ribeye (130 gr). Meat quality excellent, we found the best Wagyu pieces with higher fat content. Due to the ripening, the meat has a special taste - extremely delicious. Just add some salt and pepper and you're done. As a side dish we had a green salad, grilled vegetables and potato wedges and as starter fried dumplings. The quality of the side dishes was also top. We paid 90 € (including beer, water, cocktail), which is of course expensive for Vietnam but quite inexpensive for this enjoyment. Also the service was top. Our waiter Trinh has a very pleasant attentive nature and helped us with the barbecue (the meat is pre-grilled medium-rare and then finished grilling at the table grill according to taste). Conclusion: If you like to eat meat and want to treat yourself, this is the place for you.",
      "Excellent place to eat grilled beef and pork. A great combination of cuts that serve with very delicious Korean tapas. The salads are very delicious too. The price is a little higher than the average of other restaurants; but it is well worth it for the quality of the meat, the combinations of sauces and different types of salts.",
      "Dining at this Hanoi steakhouse is a world-class experience, unique in its charm. The quality of meat is exceptional, rivaling the best steakhouses globally. Their cocktails are a delightful journey in flavors, adding to the exquisite dining atmosphere. The staff strikes a perfect balance between attentiveness and discretion; they're not only highly professional and fluent in English but also intuitively responsive, ensuring comfort without intruding on your privacy. It's a place where culinary excellence meets impeccable service."

      "I had the pleasure of dining at RK Spice Indian Restaurant during my visit to Hanoi, and it was an experience worth every bite! Nestled in the vibrant Old Quarter, this restaurant serves some of the most authentic Indian food I’ve had outside of India. The menu is extensive, offering a range of North Indian, South Indian, and Mughlai dishes. The flavors are rich and bold, with each dish prepared to perfection. I particularly enjoyed the golab jamun—an absolute treat! The butter chicken was creamy and delicious, and the naan was freshly baked, soft, and warm. One of the things that stood out to me was the simplicity of the restaurant. RK Spice isn’t about fancy interiors; it’s about delivering incredible food at reasonable prices. This approach has clearly resonated with diners, as the place was buzzing with both locals and tourists alike. The service was top-notch. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, making sure our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish. Whether you’re a fan of Indian food or someone looking to try something new, RK Spice should be at the top of your list when in Hanoi. If you’re in the Old Quarter and craving a taste of India, don’t miss out on this gem! This should provide a different perspective while highlighting the key features of your restaurant.",
      "We came across this place when looking for an alternative to all the Vietnamese restaurants. The food was excellent, especially the many mutton dishes and the service was prompt and friendly. The owner, a cricket aficionado, was very attentive and keen to know what we thought of the food. We would certainly recommend this as a spicy and tasty alternative while in Hanoi.",
      "I visited this restaurant last week and had an excellent experience. The food was delicious, full of authentic flavors, and made with fresh ingredients. The staff was friendly and welcoming, providing great service. Prices were very reasonable, making it a great value for money. If you're looking for tasty halal food in Hanoi, this place is a must-visit!"

      "I was walking to eat at around 9pm on a weeknight, and I passed once, but went back and entered. The reason I decided to enter the restaurant was that it was clean from the outside. I travel alone a lot, so I have a lot to worry about when I eat, but the friendly staff here said, \"There's a table in the back of the shop, which one would you rather have?\" It was very impressive that he confirmed his intention. Even though I was a single guest, I was very grateful to be shown to a quiet back seat. He understands that I'm hot and adjusts the fan, and is very considerate. Order Xôi Hàng Quà for dinner. I ordered it without any prior knowledge, so I was curious about what kind of meal would be served, but it was a bowl of so-called sticky rice topped with meat, sausages and vegetables. Many restaurants around town have stiffer meats, but that hasn't changed here. The flavor is just right. The amount is also satisfactory to most people if it is an adult male. It may be a bit more for women. After the meal, order an additional Vietnamese coffee with salted cream. It tastes good in other cafes, but I was able to enjoy it well here. There's plenty of ice in there and there's no sense of cutting corners at all, which you see sometimes in Vietnam.",
      "Hi, I'm Teresa from Singapore. Their salted coffee and sticky rice were delicious! The staff was approachable & friendly and I had a very nice chat with him (I forgot to ask for his name). They have a very adorable Corgi mixed Siberian Husky dog (Dom). Thank you for the very pleasant dining experience for my last night in Hanoi. Highly recommend this place! :)",
      "Food and coffee was just amazing. The cafe is really cozy and friendly staff ;). The Bahn mi sandwich was simple but memorable. The rice combo dishes and chicken noodle soup are perfect light lunches."

      "We had an amazing meal with entrees and main, the meals were very large serving and so tasty, the staff were amazing the drinks were cold the aircon was on and it was just a great experience. Highly recomend the pork belly bites, the ribs the steak and the garlic bread all the foods we had. Yum",
      "We’re in Saigon on a school trip from the UK, two teachers with ten teenagers. The students asked for a mix of western and Vietnamese foods for dinner and we stumbled across The Big Pig which beat our expectations. Being such a big group we managed to reserve a table a couple of hours earlier. We had a warm welcome on arrival and we’re quickly offered food and drink menus. There was a great choice of food to keep everyone happy. The students told us the Smoothies were the best yet (and they’ve had several from across the city!). The food was tasty with generous portions all came out fresh and hot from the kitchen. We had burgers, pizzas with a lot of side dishes and left with many clean plates - a huge sign of happy teenagers! Fab place for tasty food to please all tastes, and really well located right by the Siagon Skydeck, making our evening even easier. The staff were excellent always on hand to help and serve us quickly. Brilliant work.",
      "Really professional friendly service, welcoming and polite showing my wife and I the full food menu and drinks menu before we were seated by Lewis who was brilliant 🤩 Our waiter this evening was Le Nhu Y who was exceptional in his service. A friendly smile and a very warming personality who makes guests feel so welcoming. The restaurant is very spacious with a few levels. The beer was ice cold and the cheeseburger & fries was really nice reminding me of a good burger from back home,many thanks for your service 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

      "We were served by Chris, super helpful and cute, we took as an appetizer the rolls with crab and that with mixed super good fish and combined each with a sauce in my opinion much better those with crab. Then bamboo cane skewers with chicken and sweet bread balls also paired with a semi-sweet sauce with salt and lime to accompany. To conclude shrimp skewers with super spicy mixed spices accompanied with clouds and squid in super good tamarind sauce in total we spent in 3 the modest amount of 59 €. The place super clean and very cozy.",

      "The service was super friendly and efficient! When all the food came out it was all hot which is amazing for 6 burgers. Quan was super funny and friendly. Speaks English quite well so it made for good conversations and great service. Even gave us some recommendations to see in Hà Nội. Even though we came quite late and close to closing time they didn’t rush us or degraded the food quality or service so we all really enjoyed it. The burgers were juicy and delicious and the the truffle chips are a MUST. Would recommend if you wanna change up from Vietnamese cuisine to some American styled burgers.",
      "If you are traveling in the city and feel like burgers, you can eat here with pleasant and not too loud music. Personnel: I was served mainly by the very nice Mike, but can also say that the others were also very friendly and always had a smile on their lips. To the kitchen: I had a burger (fresh ingredients that you can also taste) with fries and dessert. In terms of taste and appearance, a recommendation from me. For the price: Although a bit more expensive (about 13€ incl. dessert and drink)."

      "I stayed at this restaurant with friends because we felt like a nice hamburger after days of local cuisine. The place is faithfully reminiscent of the American ones, the staff is welcoming and friendly. We tasted the classic burgers (very good) with chips and coke (you can refill the drink for free once you finish). We spent about 10/15 € each, including two desserts that surprised us particularly, given the loyalty with those eaten in America.",
      "We looked up restaurants close by and Eddie's came on the scope. So we popped in for dinner and tried some burgers, what sensational burgers absolutely top class and the staff were attentive to our needs and happy to engage in friendly chat. We will definitely be back for more. Also the apple pie was the best. Our main man Tai who served us was the best.",
      "Eddie’s is the real deal! Started by an American ex-patriot from Minnesota, it serves up fresh, authentic diner food in a casual atmosphere. Where else can you get a tuna melt in Saigon? Eddie’s serves breakfast all day, along with burgers, cheese steaks, fries, onion rings and even chicken parm! Yes, they make their own ice cream, too. Servers are fluent in English, so there’s no menu-pointing required to order your favorites. When you’re half a world away from Katz’s and craving a corned beef Reuben, Eddie’s is the place."

Found this atmospheric Italian restaurant about 100yards from the New World Hotel and were seated on the first floor balcony. Food was delicious with a couple of us having Lasagna and others fish served by delightful staff.",
      "After two weeks on the road in Vietnam, we wanted something a bit different for dinner. We found this place online and decided to try it out. It was a great decision ! . Walking distance from our hotel, we went upstairs and sat outside to watch the happenings on the street. It's not too noisy and the weather was warm. The very nice waitress was with us in minutes and we ordered a glass of red and white house wine, a salad, and some pasta with prawns and a pizza. The salad was fantastic, the wine very good and the pasta and pizza as good as you'd get in Italy !! . The dinner was that good that we actually went BACK the following night for dinner and it was brilliant yet again ! Same waitress, very nice - and friendly service. . Around $80 Australian dollars for 2 and that included bottle of wine. . Highly recommend.",
      "The restaurant was close to our hotel and after a long trip walking around the area looking for dinner. We both ordered pasta dishes finished off with the passion fruit panna cotta. The pasta was ok, the dessert very good. What warranted the rating was the attentiveness of the staff which makes all the difference."

It is on Tran Vu, the first street after the bridge to the left. Not a big place, probably very busy at night with the bar. We ate upstairs, very quaint. Food is excellent. The French onion soup & creme brûlée were outstanding. I had a special which was similar to a shepherd's pie but made with duck & it was delicious. My husband tried the lasagna - it was good but not what he would consider lasagna. We ate here a second time and had the hamburgers, really done well. It's not easy to find Western food in Hanoi.",

      "A very good indication is always if an Italian restaurant outside of Italy, has many Italian or native speaking Italian guests. Long story short: service, food, drinks – summarized – very good. You can spend a nice evening there in a relaxing atmosphere with good music in the background. Price - value is in a very good ratio",
      "A trip to Italy even in these times is possible, no visa nor CoVid test required. This restaurant serves the very best of Italy: atmosphere, great flavours and dolce vita. The refreshing Aperol Spritz creates the first WoW, awesome al dente pasta, homemade minestrone, antipasti della casa follow before the main course. We love the pizze e calzone, also the grilled fresh tuna steak with olives, capers, oregano and tomato sauce. Prosecco sweetens our lunch before delicious Tiramisu and Panna Cotta with berries. Not to forget the sound of the typical Italian coffee machine producing worldclass espresso. Adriano Celentano & Monica Bellucci join us for the grappa and Amalfi coast limoncello... Viva l’ Italia",
      "Maybe the best Italian in town with homemade fresh pasta like linguine alla Sarda with fresh prawns, mussels in a slightly spicy tomato or white wine sauce. We love the original Napoli style pizze and the house special ravioli and truffle risotto. Feels like a trip to Italy 🇮🇹 despite travel restrictions! Cheers, btw their Aperol Spritz is fabulous, followed by delicious Panna Cotta or Tiramisu and iced Amalfi style Limoncello... buon appetito"

      "We found this place by accident, as it’s not centrally located and has such an unimaginative name. It was such a pleasant surprise, as this is undoubtedly among the best phở in Vietnam! Go for the house special; the delicious pho broth and cooked meat (which includes brisket and oxtail) is served in stone bowls, so remains piping hot for almost the whole meal. You can order extra sides, like tendon, blood, an egg, etc, but sadly no tripes. The raw meat and noodles come separately, and you throw them into the bowl. Unique among phở restaurants anywhere in the world, they make their noodles fresh from scratch here, and you can observe the whole process through the glass window. Boy, it makes a difference, freshly-made noodles are much, much better than the packaged dry ones served elsewhere. Crispy yu-tiao (extra price) is left on the table; I highly recommend you dip it in the broth for additional delish texture. Service is excellent, they’re super quick at bringing you requests for extra stuff, like fresh lime, etc. Our go-to",
      "Crowded restaurant, mainly frequented by Vietnamese. Just pho with fresh pasta and beef (your choice of fillet meatballs, tail ribs, etc.). Served either in bowls (small, medium, large) or cast iron casseroles filled with boiling broth into which you throw the raw meat, your fresh pasta, your Thai basil and your bean sprouts. From 70,000 to 110,000 VND. It's exotic, it's noisy, it's fast. Everything we love about Vietnam."

      "Firstly I’d like to say thank you to Xavier and his staff for a lovely experience in Ho Chi Minh City for their friendly approach making you feel very welcome in Cocotte, a truly beautiful restaurant. We were both blown away with the quality of food and drinks at a very reasonable price. Signature dish is the French Onion soup covered in Emmental cheese which tasted like a traditional dish. We also had the Tuna with Wasabi beurreblanc and the beef ravioli, both were excellent and washed down with a very nice bottle of Cremant which was excellent. Many thanks for a great evening.",
      "I discovered Cocotte through a friend's recommendation. Located in Sila Urban Hotel, I tried the food here last week and found myself smitten with the pan-fried duck breast served with a fragrant black pepper sauce. The dish stands out more when paired with a glass of red wine, stimulating the dish's richer taste. In addition, the space is also very chill, and the service is extremely friendly. I will definitely come back.",
      "This is a French restaurant that really impressed us. The food was delicious and the price is really reasonable. Another nice surprise was that we found the exact taste we had in France (some of my us are french). A place you should try! And enjoy some of the best dishes that are also signature dishes of this restaurant: duck magret, duck confit, rosbif"

      "Wonderful food! Would definitely recommend if you are vegetarian too - my friend is and she really enjoyed her meal. Our waiter Kien was very helpful and he showed my friend how to eat her “traditional Hanoi pork” with rice paper. He also had a lot of patience with us when we were sorting the bill.",
      "The food at this restaurant was some of the best my wife and I have eaten in Vietnam. Went back twice in 4 days and both times the food was excellent, portions generous and service quick and friendly all at a very reasonable price. The make your own Vietnamese pancake was especially delicious. The restaurant was clean and welcoming but not fancy decor wise but that doesn’t matter as the food is the main event. We booked a table through their Instagram. They do walk ins but each time we went there was a queue for that which seemed to have around a 15 minute wait time. Would highly recommend for great food and service",
      "My husband was looking for somewhere for our last dinner in HCMC and found De Tham. We were warmly greeted and fortunately for us, a comfortable table had just opened up so we were quickly seated. The menu is good with plenty of regional options plus a fairly extensive vegetarian/vegan selection. Our waiter, Jack, was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly so any questions we had were answered and we felt very well taken care of. My husband ordered us the fried eggplant as a starter and had the grilled beef served in bamboo as his entree while I enjoyed the caramelized pork and quail eggs. I had a glass of red wine from Dalat Vietnam and a lime soda (lime juice, a can of soda water and a small jug of simple syrup so you can mix it to your palate!) and my husband tried a couple of the Vietnamese beers they offered. The eggplant was crispy and tasty and we enjoyed the chili sauce for dipping so much that Jack brought us more. The beef was delicious, tasted chargrilled and looked appealing served up in bamboo. My bowl of pork and quail eggs was so comforting, the broth tasted like it had been simmered with love for hours at Grandmas house. We shouldn’t have ordered the banana split to share but we did and had no regrets, it too, was well executed. Prices are reasonable for District 1 and portions quite generous. Thank you Jack for taking such good care of us!"

      "Culinary experience of the highest level, where flavors of Asian cuisine steeped in spices and aromas give life to an alchemy that demonstrates the personality of the chef, less experienced in molecular techniques, expressed in many courses between spherification and gelation not perfectly successful. The rest very well worked out. Michelin is rigid in its 360-degree evaluations... here it has blindfolded in the service, albeit sympathetic waiters. Minimal tone in the mise en place. Too bad they replaced the wine glass with a beautiful water glass in fine Hungarian crystal .. Modest location , jap style but advanced technologies that maybe make you feel in an interstellar space and that, fortunately, you forget as soon as you are out to find yourself in the magical Saigon.... long live Vietnamese Cuisine!!",

Rita was our server, and she was so helpful that it made the entire experience seamless. Highly recommended!"

      "The setting is superb. Fast and efficient service despite the size of our group. The dishes are very generous (too much) but not as fragrant as in the other restaurants where we stopped during our tour. The spring rolls for example were huge but only tasted like meat. Spring rolls not as good as elsewhere. Completely incomprehensible: we asked for towels to replace the wet towel intended to cool our hands. There are no paper towels and wet ones are charged extra...",
      "This restaurant downtown was suggested by our guide. The façade of the restaurant is very lit and richly decorated with plastic plants and flowers. The interior consists of various rooms and other tables are in a large courtyard in front, all lavishly decorated. The tables are pretty close. The menu was very varied and enriched with photos to illustrate the individual dishes. Food is normal and portions plentiful. The service was efficient considering the considerable number of tables but completely impersonal. There are no architectural barriers to get to the front tables.",
      "In the central area of Ho Chi Minh City, this restaurant offers a well-kept environment both inside and outside. The service does not shine for friendliness but you eat well and with a wide choice. I definitely recommend it also in light of the now 2 weeks of local cuisine. I count around 30 euros for 4 dishes and 4 beers."

The staff were extremely knowledgeable of the business ethos and how they value not just quality coffee but genuine relationships with their coffee suppliers and methods of growing coffee that are sustainable.",
      "Staff is friendly and study coffee well. They can recommend suitable coffee based on your demand. They serve tasty cascara tea for free after you enjoy the coffee. Only a pity is that some pastry are already sold out even I came early in the morning. Not easy to find this kind of cafe for special coffee beans. Price is quite expensive compared to the typical Vietnamese coffee shops, however it worth trying !"

It is a very spacious, modern area with tables, more relaxed seating and chairs at the bar as well. The mostly young staff are well trained and have great communication skills. Our waitress on both occasions, Huyen, was extremely attentive and eager to please. She recognised us the second day and greeted us warmly which was lovely. We were very impressed!"

      "This is a super cute little Belgian beer bar, cafe and restaurant just a couple of minutes walk from The Pink Church and directly opposite Quan Pho Huong Binh for those of you on the Michelin credited pho restaurant trail, as we were. We noticed it across the street and stumbled in out of curiosity. Lovely, rustic wooden decor over several floors in a typically narrow HCMC-style dwelling squeezed, almost impossibly, into the shaft of space between buildings. A huge selection of bottled Belgian beer and several good quality staples on draft as well (I had a draft Vedette, she had a bottle of Grimbergen blonde). Really lovely staff - the young lady who served us was particularly helpful in recommending the best pho places to visit if you want to eat like a local. Hint: they are not on the Michelin credited list. But if you want to find out more about that, I suggest you pop in and ask yourself…",
      "The first time I came here, I was impressed by the cozy feeling and the unique decoration style with beer bottles, creating a very suitable space to enjoy beer. The shop has many varieties from Belgium and has many choices from light to heavy, serving many customer groups. The service staff are very enthusiastic and attentive. I will definitely come back again!! ✨✨",
      "I had the opportunity to visit Lagom and was really impressed with the way the shop represents the culture of Belgian beer. First, the restaurant's space is very comfortable and cozy. I feel like I'm in a little corner of Belgium. There are many unique decorative details, including paintings of famous Belgian beers. Soothing European-sounding background music creates a relaxing atmosphere ideal for enjoying beer. The shop's biggest strength is its diverse Belgian beer list. I tried many different beers and each one was interesting in story and rich in flavor. The bar's staff is very knowledgeable about Belgian beer and helped me choose the one that suits my taste. In addition, the shop also has a variety of snacks to pair with beer. I tried a few dishes such as a delicious cold charcuterie cup and a plate of beef with fragrant red pepper sauce. Although the prices are somewhat higher than some other shops, for all that the shop offers, it is a worthy experience investment. If you are a Belgian beer lover and want to experience the country's authentic beer culture, this is a great destination. I will definitely return to this restaurant in the future."

      "Residing at Le Meridien Saigon where this restaurant is located, I tried it for both breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is of a good standard, not a lot of choice and variety but what is there remains of quality. The fruit and/or vegetable juice freshly centrifuged to order is very appreciable. For dinner, however, I ordered a la carte, again not a lot of choice but well-prepared dishes in a mix of international and local cuisine. The price is very high for Vietnam but considering that this restaurant could be in any other metropolis in the world, you choose when you want to be safe",
      "Tonight I dined at Le Meridien restaurant on Ton Duc Thang Street, District 1. Although the restaurant is buffet, I tried à la carte to experience the food here. I must say that the dishes I ordered to try were Mekong salad, cod fish eaten with rice... especially the fries served with shaking beef were delicious, very delicious. And the attentive, cheerful, enthusiastic waiters made the atmosphere as well as the meal more delicious. Thank you Yen, Van, Ngoc, My Dung, and Thu, for your very dedicated service.",
      "Came here for breakfast and was impressed by the service. The waitstaff are responsive and kind, and speak English well for those who do not speak Vietnamese. Maru Nguyen served us and was polite and friendly. She speaks English well and was able to answer our questions with ease. The food was good, with choices of American breakfast, Chinese food, pastries, and Vietnamese food. Nguyet or Luna, the head chef who makes Pho, is very personable and greets you when you come to her station. She is very helpful and makes great food recommendations. The pho that she and her staff makes is delicious! My family and I had a great experience."

      "The restaurant's understated and elegant décor is a perfect interpretation of French sophistication. The specialty steak is served with a secret butter sauce, and the meat is tender and juicy. The wine list is impressive, with a selection of wines from Burgundy to Bordeaux. The service team is professional and welcoming, giving us a true sense of French hospitality. The most amazing thing is that they follow the traditional French recipe strictly and each dish is full of craftsmanship. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth a special occasion. This is a rare romantic dating spot in Saigon!",
      "The signature entrecôte steak was cooked to perfection, swimming in their secret sauce. Generous portions had us swooning, while the authentic French atmosphere transported us straight to Montmartre. Absolutely smitten with their crème brûlée!"

      "Honestly, one of the best restaurants I’ve been too. The location and the view is beautiful, and they have live music with a good variety on music type on saturdays that made the vibe even better. Now, the first impression, except from the view was the staff. All the staff were smiling and seemed happy which for me is very important that you can see and sense that they do wanna be there and work, and that you’re not bothering them or that they just wanted the evening to be over. Our waitress of the evening was Mocha and the service she gave was first class in my opinion as a former waitress. She went out of the way to explain the dishes to us, recommending dishes and ordered small portions for us to try. One thing I was impressed by was that she noticed that I ate the oysters raw, and therefore she recommended other dishes that contained raw fish like ceviche. She made sure that we had everything needed and didn’t mind to do everything so the evening would turn out the best for us as customers. The food was so fresh and seasoned so well. The range of seafood wasn’t very big but here it’s definitely quality over quantity and honestly, you don’t need much more than what they have. The only thing I can point out was the pasta dish that they prepare upon order. If you start with it, it might turn out great. But we had it for last and after all the fresh seafood it tasted a bit too salty for us. But definitely nothing wrong with the seasoning or so. In conclusion, I would not even hesitate to eat here again.",
      "Great service and great quality of food! Our server Mocha was the best, she was very attentive and gave us great hospitality, truly a 5 star rating. The A4 Wagyu and fresh seafood was Devine and worth the price, definitely would recommend!",
      "My wife and I went on her birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed the late lunch, we had the 990,000 dong Pho (which was a whole different experience - the meat quality of the Pho is better here but the flavor of the Reverie pho is better in my opinion. Com ga Hoi A was a pleasant partner to the Signature Pho. The service from Mocha was exceptional. We also appreciated the birthday cake (gratis) and Mocha taking endless pictures of us and the surrounding breathtaking views. Landmark is also known for its great seafood buffet."

Couple of dissatisfaction points: mains a little lacking for vegetarians - we asked for vegetarian fajitas instead of chicken but restaurant was not willing to improvise to accommodate; If you are wine drinkers make sure you check they have enough bottles in stock for your group (12 people), ours ran out after 2 bottles - restaurant had no equivalent price alternative, the next option was almost twice the price. Could improve with accommodating customers better.",
      "We had anniversary dinner here and were absolutely blown away with the food we received. It was beautiful and some of the best food we have ever eaten. Wasn't cheap by Vietnamese standards but to have the same quality meal at home we would've paid double the price we paid here. Would recommend this restaurant for any couple that want to treat themselves whilst on holiday 10/10",
      "This is a great, vibrant restaurant with excellent food, cocktails/drinks and service! The atmosphere was lively as it was busy with lots of young people enjoying HCMC at night. There was a couple of birthday celebrations that staff supported with a cake and singing. My partner chose the chilli con carne and duck and I chose the warm cheese & chorizo and seafood with orzo. All of the food was delicious, hot and plentiful. We were given a cheesecake dessert free as there was a very slight delay in the main courses not arriving together. Staff were helpful, efficient, smiley and created a lovely atmosphere for a great dining experience! I would highly recommend this restaurant 😊"

Great place to relax and watch tourists come by. A guard is at the only entrance. A cafe owner will come and bring you in. It’s their way to manage the crowd given the authorities’ concerns with safety issues given the trains. You can choose which cafe to go to.",
      "Check train times before you go so you can see the train. The train goes past about 9 times a day, some are spaced a hour or so apart and some in the evening. There are about 10 spots to stop and have a drink on the small section of track. Of course you have to purchase a drink to sit down at a shop but it’s the standard price. 20k - 50k for a beer with lots of juices and snacks to be had. We stayed for 45min and had 2 beers a ice tea and a smoothie for 115k dong. If you don’t want to spend money you can walk up and down the track and just take pictures for no charge"

Eg pancakes for duck are incredibly thick and doughy, the dishes are highly salty (maybe don’t check your blood pressure reading on the same evening of dining). Pricey for Vi standards but a nice treat if you fancy something different. The dim sum (crab and prawn) cannot be faulted and the service is speedy. Solid 3.5/5.",
      "We ate there early, so we had the benefit of a quiet restaurant. I can honestly say I don't remember the last time I ate dimsum so good! Fresh ingredients.... every prawn dimsum was meaty and you could see and taste the prawns... it was really outstanding. Also the Hong Kong style pork was great.... Our server Ván Anh was extremely friendly and helpful! Huge compliments to her. Overall really no complaints, and I would definitely eat here again.",
      "Very average food with a Pekin Duck ( the house specialty, it seems..), served with only one kind of sauce (no Chinese mustard, no pickled chilli) chewy and tasteless. The Dim Sum were standard, with little difference in taste from one to another. Dining rooms are pleasantly lit, the service efficient. Last visit."

      "It looked like a classic Vietnamese souvenir shop, and I walked to the hotel in front of Hanoi station where I stayed. It took me about 10 minutes to get there, but I found myself facing a road just down the street, so I had to rely on navigation if I didn't know. There was a showcase of cakes as soon as I entered the store, and when I ordered recommended products and drinks, they served me to the eat-in space at the back. Further into the eat-in space was a handmade workshop where visitors could watch demonstrations. There was a dedicated corner by the entrance for tea and souvenirs, which could be purchased here, but because it was hot outside, you had to be careful about the take-home time.",
      "I came to the cafe for the sweets. It's fun just looking at the sweets in the cafe's showcase. The beer mug-style chocolate sweets I was looking for were not sold out yet. There are so many types of chocolate in the shop corner that it can be confusing, but you can sample them. You can have fun selecting items. I chose a standard set as a souvenir for home. The price is high, but you can buy it cheaper than buying it in Tokyo."

      ". Ate here on our first & last nights in Vietnam, initially recommended by our hotel reception . The ambience was tranquil, with an airy semi open area at front and plenty more space under cover Tables were spaced well apart and the food delicious, My duck breast was perfectly cooked & my husband’s stir fried beef fillet soft and succulent. Desserts were also fabulous. The staff were lovely, just the right level of attentiveness. A special mention for Chilie, our lovely waitress on both occasions- she recognised us straight away on our 2nd visit even gave us a sketch of our meal, drawn while we were eating, to give us as a memento. This is the perfect spot for a celebration or just a good slap up meal.",
      "Gorgeous restaurant with event outdoor and indoor seating. Set menu was the perfect amount of traditional yet elevated Vietnamese food. The spices, flavourings, and textures were really a cut above other places we have eaten (and loved) in Vietnam. On top of this the young, vibrant staff (who all speak fluent English) were impeccable. Both polite and friendly it made us feel really at home. Special shout out to Ms Chi Le who also gave us a great bar recommendation for later!",
      "We dined in this beautiful place. The restaurant , in a beautiful house elegantly restored , is quiet and offers a lovely room and two charming courtyards. We tasted refined dishes full of flavor and finesse. The kitchen is really upscale! The welcome of the whole team is exceptional , Miss Chile is adorable, professional and speaks very good English. Thank you , it was a last dinner that ended our trip to Vietnam and we will keep a wonderful memory. Do not hesitate to discover this place in Hanoi!"

    "description": "Founded in December 2008, La Badiane -French for Star Anise spice- is heralding its claim to be one of the best restaurants in Vietnam, dedicated to fusion of flavors and international gastronomy. As reference, La Badiane is rated top 500 Restaurants in Asia by The Miele Guide, has been recommended by The New York Times, and has received 5 consecutive Certificates of Excellence by Trip Advisor -since 2011. Indeed, with more than 300 upvotes as “EXCELLENT”, La Badiane knows a high rating deserved to top-end restaurants. Yet, if most is about tastes, fusion of flavors and international gastronomy, great attention is also constantly paid to the quality of the service provided as well as to the overall atmosphere, so guests have a unique culinary experience by enjoying every aspect of their meal. When coming in, one’s attention is instantly caught by the multitude of perfumes & aromas flowing out from the open front kitchen. The entrance corridor planted with harmonious luxuriant vegetation leads you towards the heart of the restaurant, and its glass covered patio. Surrounded by carefully chosen leaf plants, walls predominantly white, and large B&W photo portraits, the place provides for a true feeling of calm and elegance. The combination of tablecloths, two-color curtains, and the green vegetation gathers all conditions to let guests’ visual and gustative senses fully express themselves. The attentive and discreet lightening in the evening makes it very romantic, and live classic music concerts every Wednesday evening levels-up La Badiane restaurant to turn it into a complete place. On the upper floor, two rooms available provide for perfect intimate spaces, appropriate for guests either looking for privacy, or mid-size groups wishing to enjoy a private lunch or dinner on a special occasion. As opposed to the ground floor and its B&W photos, the first floor presents large-size color portraits. A must-see.",

      "Tonight, my wife and I ate at La Badiene, and the experience was simply wonderful. I booked the restaurant from Australia via email - the communication was very easy, clear, and timely. From the moment we arrived, the staff were fantastic - chilled, but super attentive. We had the degustation menu and at their suggestion we had the Signature menu and Fusion menu and shared each dish, this doubled the number of dishes we had, but also doubled the amount of work for the kitchen and staff. Throughout the meal, the waiters offered additional bread, making sure that we had enough for the pate, etc. The meals were beautifully crafted, full of flavour, and complemented the other courses. On completion of our meal, our waiter helped us book a Grab (Uber), and another of the staff waited with us until it arrived. We often eat at restaurants, but La Badiene is exceptional - Great food and wonderful staff. If you're in Hanoi and looking for a special night out, this is it. 11 out of 10",
      "This is a beautiful place. We ordered a four-course lunch, and the quality started incredibly high and gradually declined over the courses. I think the starters were best because they were relatively simple, so the excellent preparation and great flavours really shone through. But the mains and desserts felt over-complicated, with too many ingredients, not all of which seemed to belong together. They'd look great on Instagram, but weren't so satisfying to eat. Overall, though, a very good meal. The staff tried hard to provide what they clearly think of as good service, but to me it was very annoying. They were constantly fussing over us and making a big production of doing simple and/or completely unnecessary things like unfolding napkins, clearing crumbs from the table and putting down empty plates between each course and then taking them away again. But when we actually wanted something, they were nowhere to be found, and the bill took so long to arrive that my wife had to get up and fetch it herself. To me, good service is unobtrusively efficient, but this was inefficiently obtrusive. Probably wouldn't come back.",
      "As you walk through the entrance with the glass panelled kitchen, you immediately feel special in this place of warm welcome sophistication.. from the beautiful black and white portrait prints that adorn the walls, to the head chef Benjamin coming and introducing himself to customers. But wow.. it’s the the tastes & the fusion of flavours, combined with the quality of service that you must come and experience. There is so much creativity in the combination of flavours & spices that pair so well together. Do yourself a favour when looking for a special meal. Come to this place. They have well priced degustation lunches that change weekly or simply try their individual meals… whichever you choose you won’t be disappointed."

      "One of the most expensive Western restaurants I've ever been to and enjoyed. The Nordic food menu is extremely diverse, including ordering by portion or individual dishes. We got to try a lot of strange dishes that we have never tried before. When the wait staff brought it out, they fully introduced the name of the dish and even the main ingredients of the dish. Each dish is served in a fairly small quantity, we came here to determine this in advance and the price is also very luxurious. Professional and polite service staff, luxurious space.",
      "I have been to this restaurant since attracted by reviews. I must say that what I tasted was partly amazing, partly normal. There are some things that, perhaps out of Italian habit and not only, did not convince me so much, like the fact that wine and water are not left at the table, but the waiter, every time he sees the empty glass comes with the bottle and pours what you need. Too bad that the white wine we chose arrived at the right temperature only at the end from dinner! That said: - pros: environment and dishes, some dishes with exclusive taste, attentive service, but not too much; - cons: drinks not left available to diners, some dishes with a bit 'flat flavor, price in my opinion not justified compared to the offer and prices of the place (although I understand it is a high-end restaurant), the waiter who once outside the room (right on the street), asks which dishes were liked more and which ones you liked less ... even today I do not understand why these questions are asked outside the restaurant. Otherwise, would I come back? Safe not. Would I recommend it? Yes, if you have an additional budget to spend differently... as I said above, some dishes are really crazy!",
      "Giving T.U.N.G. Dining anything less than five stars is a travesty and does a disservice to creative cooking. Listen, I’m 74, was part owner of three restaurants, and have dined at the culinary temples of the world including many three star Michelin restaurants. T.U.N.G Dining is on par with most of them. Our 17 dishes tickled our senses of smell, taste, and sight. The culinary journey was a trip to Wonderland and Oz. The photos tell part of the story, but everything also tasted delicious. Service was charming and helpful, and everyone displayed pride in what they were serving. Pricing is extremely high for Vietnam, coming to around $280 for two including tax and tip. T.U.N.G. Dining is worth every penny."

      "Wonderful classy French restaurant. My wife and I went on a recommendation from a tour guide and were not disappointed. Beautiful setting and excellent food and service. We had the four course option with wine and everything was great. I’m not a real big dessert person, but with the 4 courses I selected the strawberry/orange cheesecake and it was flavorful, smooth and light as air. Amazing. And for those who come from another big city (we come from NYC) the cost is very reasonable. Highly recommended.",
      "We had a price fix dinner that include a voice of appetizers and a selection of entrees. Included were dessert and wine. Food was excellent. I had the Basa Fish Bouilabaisse style entree which was quite different that other Bouilabaisse dishes I have had in the past. This did not have a broth, yet it was terrific.",
      "We were very impressed with the quality of the food, the ambience in the restaurant, and the attention the staff paid to us. We could not fault anything. A well-informed local recommended to us the restaurant for fine French dining. We ordered two sets comprising Starter, Soup, Maim and Dessert. The choices for the sets, which we consulted with the staff, as well as for wine, turned out to be perfect. The beef cheeks, particularly, were juicy and delicious. A meal like this for one person would easily set us back by more than A$100 in Australia, but we paid under US$60 for two. Thank you for giving my wife and I such a beautiful dining experience. You are an important addition to Hanoi's fine culinary scene."

      "We just enjoyed a tasteful lunch at this small but famous restaurant. Food was very fresh and service was good although the restaurant was crowded and it all went very quick. Would certainly recommend to visit this restaurant if you stay in Hanoi. It definitely is worth visiting",
      "I was told to by the glove driver, but I had made a mistake. But I had never eaten Buncha before, so I tried it. I eat a sweet dipping sauce with vegetables and noodles. By the time I finished eating, I was bored with the sweetness and greasyness. Fried spring rolls are delicious."

      "Very conveniently close to the Masjid an Noor. V good quality Indian/Pakistani cuisine , very reasonably priced. Friendly and efficient service. No long wait for good food. Be cautious when ordering especially on a hungry tummy...The portions are very generous and the meals on the menu are often substantial enough for 2 adults to share. If you've over ordered management will gladly oblige if you have leftover food to be packed for taking home.",
      "One of the best Indian Restaurant in Hanoi city and is very close to maximum hotels. Food is so Delicious and Tasty in reasonable best price. The team is very polite and humble. I recommend people to prefer this Restaurant without any doubt.",
      "Vietnamese people may not like Indian food, and the price is higher than the average of local restaurants, but I love it! Authentic spice cuisine, you can eat delicious vegetarian or meat, masala, thali, biryani... It is worth exploring here. In Hanoi, a city full of imagination, eating delicious South Asian food is totally worth the money!"

      "First of all, the restaurant is more than rustic, the chairs and tables are hand-made, the floor is bare concrete; the air is quite smoky due to the various table grills. The restaurant is always busy, however, as it is comparatively cheap. The barbecue itself is an experience, you grill yourself at your table on small charcoal grills, we tried beef and pork, both very nicely marinated and nicely flavorful! In conclusion, it's not for a quiet dinner for two, but if you like grilled food and a good beer, you're in good hands here.",
      "Great place for cook your own bbq - great atmosphere and service. Ordered the eggplant which was amazing along with the morning glory with garlic. For the bbq the pork and beef were both delicious but the octopus was very tough. The accompanying sauces were all delicious too. Beers were ice cold."

      "We were looking for a romantic setting with Vietnamese cuisine, knowing how much my girlfriend loves Vietnamese dishes. As Vietnamese ourselves, we’ve tasted countless dishes across the country, but KotoSt25 redefined our palate of how Vietnamese cuisine can be presented in such an elegant and exuberant setting. We opted for a set menu at Koto, which was authentically Vietnamese, rich in flavors that brought us back home, yet delivered with a Western twist that elevated our dining experience. Every bite was a rediscovery, from the spring rolls with well-braised Vietnamese-style Wagyu beef to the perfectly steamed ST25 rice. My girlfriend indulged in three cocktails, each beautifully mixed and served, with the standout being the “Canh Chua”— which amazes us enough as its taste uniquely captured quiet much resemblance to the Vietnamese tomato soup but still fit itself nicely to indulge as a cocktail. Staffs were incredibly attentive, friendly, and took lots of their effort to explain the ingredients and stories behind each dish (though we barely remembered all the details 😂). Their warmth made us feel truly appreciated and cherished. We were even greeted by the hotel’s GM and the restaurant manager, who made their rounds to ensure every guest was enjoying their meal—a truly memorable touch. It was a night that brought us even closer as a couple, and we would highly recommend KotoSt25 to anyone looking to share a lovely evening with their loved one.",
      "Lovely dinner with braised Australian wagyu beef cheek spring rolls and the Halong Bay oysters for entrees. Springs rolls were hot, flavourful, and a nice start, as were the oysters, which were huge. Our mains were the slow roasted half bbq chicken and the crispy pork belly porchetta with seasonal asian greens and the fried rice with mushrooms and baby corn. The bbq chicken was well worth the wait and was tender, moist, and full of flavour while the porchetta was very tasty but huge and more than enough for two people. Finally, our desserts were rice pudding and the pandan waffle with strawberries, cream, and soursop ice cream. The coconut and mango rice pudding was the best we ever tasted with a beautiful texture and was simply genius. The waffle for me was the perfect finish to a lovely meal. Our server, Thuy / Mille was friendly, patient and very attentive with a very strong interpersonal skills. Very approachsble and professional at the same time. 10/10",
      "Large open kitchen restaurant with lovely attentive staff, explained the dishes when presented etc etc topped up water when the glasses got low. Food was fantastic, we had the half chicken (knowing it would take 45min) and some Asian greens and of course a bowl of ST25 rice. Spring rolls for entree were great, full of beef and a great way to start. Was offered to have greens and rice whilst we wait for the main but chosen to have it together. Fantastic flavours and topped it off with dessert. We would def come back here again. Looking forward to it already. At the time of our visit they were open for lunch but only on weekends. Last dinner orders taken I think was 1030pm so a great option for late dinner. Accor Plus discount applied, I think the max discount was 30% food and the usual 20% for drinks)"

      "Went here on the complete off chance. My wife found it looking on the internet as she fancied some tapas and it did not disappoint. Food and service was excellent. The waitress was very helpful and would not let us over order and the food arrived in the perfect amount of time. Not too quick but slow enough to know it was all being prepared freshly. Open kitchen so you can see the action. Very clean and a very nice ambiance. Would highly recommend the sucking pig.",
      "Excellent food , tasty small plates to share. You won’t get tired of the same flavors ( like in a large portion) try lots of different and interesting dishes. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and good suggestions if you’re not sure what to try. Open kitchen was fun to watch the dishes being prepared! We went there twice and was not disappointed!",
      "Our group of 6 selected the We Pick, You Eat 6 course tapas menu for 900k/per person and it did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the service excellent. Our only complaint and it's a small one, was that the wait time between dishes was quite long."

      "We were taken to this place by a local employee... the place looked nice but the food was way too expensive. She ordered japanes wagyu beef, black pork mini burgers... I was surprised because it was delicious, the meat was fresh, soft and sweet... We've been to other Korean places downtown and we found them to be even better here than the original. Wow Korean restaurants in Vietnam are better than Korea, very surprising!",
      "Really good option if you're looking for something a little bit different to the local food but don't want to go for the stock options of Pizza, Burger, Pasta. We ordered a Combo meal - so a selection of different meats BBQ'd on the hot coals in front of us and it came with a wide selection of Korean style sides. Very filling and overall and excellent option. Unlike Korean BBQ I have been to in the UK/Ireland, the food is cooked for you and in front of you.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"

      "Looking at older reviews I had become a little worried, but after being served two beautiful medium rare pieces of meat by a lovely waitress, I'm happy to say this is a lovely little spot found in the art arcade in saigon. With wonderful service from the staff and pleasant Aussie cuts of beef which are about A3 rating. As someone who normally enjoys a good rib eye fillet or sirloin cut at home along with tomahawk, I know when I'm eating a well cut and cooked piece of meat. I highly reccomend the second serving platter consisting of a 350g rib eye and 350g sirloin which is cheaper than buying them separately. These also come with 2 complimentary side dishes, I don't reccomend the potato wedges and it would be a sin to eat such good quality meat with the mac and cheese, highly reccomend the sauted mushrooms. Don't be afraid to try a red with these lovely cuts as it develops overtime. To us, this was a wonderful experience with calming atmosphere.",
      "Really great food. -I went back a second time. (And I heard the table near mine raving about how good their meals were as well) Excellent service. When you rock up with an allergy list nearly as long as your arm and they accommodate that. You know the waiting staff are attentive, when you order a drink and they bring it to you, without ice, because that is how you ordered it the other time. You know they paid attention when it comes to ordering the side and they say 'you didn't eat the mushrooms last time would you like to try the salad or something else this time?' Cute location too.",
      "Absolutely delicious meal, my husband had the wagyu steak which was cooked to perfection and I had the beef steak with rose cream pasta which came with a whole steak! Absolutely delicious, wonderful ambience and lovely host. I would highly reccomend coming here over the commercial restaurants on the square. Thank you very much!"

      "Genuinely excellent food, a class above most fine dining restaurants and it was absolutely delicious throughout. I’d strongly encourage a trip even at the high costs, but… Two things stick out to me: 1. I’m still hungry. Every dish of the tasting menu was very small, and despite being very tasty I’d have gladly had a decent amount more food even if it meant sacrificing a dish or two to balance the costs. 2. A little bit of a bitter taste left in my mouth by the staff at the end. We’d made a point to ask for the bill early and to pay quickly because we had somewhere to be, yet they genuinely seemed to be making no effort to facilitate this (and indeed collecting payment from other tables ahead of us even though they were clearly not finished with their food/drinks and in one case had just had fresh drinks delivered). Overall though despite these (meaningfully frustrating) complaints I can’t bring myself to go less than five stars because the food really was exceptional.",
      "This was an excellent Michelin star experience. Know that it’s not like say an Alinia in Chicago, it’s a casual but food centric pleasure in a Vietnamese food market sort of way. Think like say Direkte Boqueria in Barcelona,(but at a typically lower Viet price point). The premises are very tall and very narrow but they manage to space everyone out in an appropriate way. They even quickly upgraded us to the air conditioned first floor from the breezy rooftop We opted for an à la cart experience although there were several rave reviews about the more expensive mixed fixed menus. The Foi Gras egg roll, while small, was loaded with taste. The duck mango salad was perfectly seasoned and very ample. My wife and I then shared the main course, choosing the pork chop specialty. Very tasty and tender. A nice surprise dessert cake for our anniversary, along with the fish sauce caramel vanilla ice cream topped off our meal and sent us off very happy and very satiated As I said, simply adjust your lense from an elegant high end Michelin to a casual but very flavourful Michelin experience. It’s all part of the fun. By the way, the staffing was very ample, all knowledgeable, warm and efficient.",
      "Service and food are very good at this Sài Gòn Michelin star eatery. The layout is on five floors, all small spaces. We ate in the roof- dry pleasant. Creative cocktails, tho’ my berry mocktail was too sweet for my taste. The fried rolls of shrimp & crab were terrific, and the deep fried fish was delicious, with the meat served in chunks on the crisp body of the whole fish. Plating of all the dishes was creative. We felt the vanilla ice cream dessert with fish sauce was a bit much-excessive showmanship that bordered on tacky. That sauce was served in a little cologne spray bottle. Fish sauce by Dior😂? The food here is expensive, which it always has been. 6 of us ate for more than $200, and we did not order wine, just drinks. I’ll still return here for a special occasion & memorable meal."

      "I went to this vegetarian restaurant with friends, relaxing and welcoming atmosphere, attentive to detail. We tasted dishes at the beginning of the dinner, which we shared (fried tuber, potato type ..) and each we chose a dish (fried rice with mushrooms, rice with pineapple and raisins ..). All very good, accompanied by fruit drinks (orange, lime and pineapple). Recommended dinner to enjoy a different evening, from the usual bars that are in the city. Cost for the city above average, we spent about 25 € each. Recommended!!",
      "The photos people have shared are excellent, but there’s so much more to experiencing all that is this building and what goes on within. The food is on another level when it comes to creativity and deliciousness. The design of the interior design compliments the beauty of the plates being served. The staff are outstanding. The photos are outstanding, but the smells and flavors are something you must experience yourself.",
      "After a stressful day, Hum truly felt like an oasis of peace. The atmosphere was calming, and the food was amongst the best we've ever tasted, with plenty of delicious vegan options to choose from. The staff were wonderful, going out of their way to help us select the perfect dishes. Special thanks to Phoung Vu for his exceptional hospitality—he looked after us so well, making sure we were 100% happy and satisfied throughout our meal. It was a dining experience we won't forget, and we highly recommend Hum to anyone seeking incredible food and warm service."

      "Central location, atmosphere of a rich man’s home in the countryside, and most comprehensive menu of typical dishes from all regions of Vietnam. Only missing are fertilised egg embryos (trứng vịt lộn or balut in the Philippines). None of the dishes is the best in its category, but they’re all pretty good. Excellent service from friendly staff. Prices are very reasonable; ignore comments from cheapskates who would be better home eating at the market or just staying home!",
      "We ate here twice during our stay. First time we ordered nine dishes as we didn’t have a clue about Vietnamese food. Next time we went we had a better idea on what and how much to order. The prawns were excellent and the waitress put on gloves and peeled them for us. Very informal dining but a lovely way to spend an evening. I would class it as outside dining and maybe the floor could be cleaner but that’s down to untidy diners. First evening was £40 nine dishes, bottle of wine and two beers. Second time £32 less dishes same amount of drink.",
      "No air conditioning, but plenty of fans to keep cool. Right across the street from the Independence Palace. Good place for lunch, but also okay for dinner. This place is rather informal in a good way. Menu has lots of pictures and English translations of each dish. Perfect restaurant to experience local cuisine in a setting that isn’t too fancy (not like those white tablecloth french colonial restaurants). The menu is quite extensive—like the Cheesecake Factory in the USA, so you can try a variety of Vietnamese exotic dishes if you’re feeling adventurous. Bathrooms reasonably clean."

      "The quality of the food was very good and the service attentive and prompt. We enjoyed the setting and the fact that there was no loud or inappropriate music. Less agreeable was the fact that all courses of a three course lunch were served on a tray simultaneously. This inevitably meant that the main course was cold by the time we had consumed the entrées. Perhaps the management interpreted a Business Lunch as placing the emphasis on speed and efficiency. In our judgement this should be reviewed in favour of a \"course by course\" serving approach rather than \"all at once\". (The day we ate there were only a handful of other diners so there was no time pressure on the staff.) This would considerably have enhanced our enjoyment.",
      "First class service in a building of a long and vital heritage. The menu was well combined und delicious prepared while everything was of a high quality standard fitting to the higher prices here. Especially if you search for a location which is quiet and has a great view this restaurant is a good pick.",
      "I feel quite satisfied I suggest that the lamb dish in the set needs more fat in the sauce. Because sheep don't eat dry food. Dessert and appetizers are okay for me The waiters here are very cute, Tran is very enthusiastic and gives thoughtful advice"

      "Second visit to this restaurant and really worth the trip: DELICIOUS, fine, tasty. Bcp people but it was Friday night, better book. After a small papaya salad with beef jerky grilled absolutely divine and to finish in style of banana grilled with coconut juice and here even the decoration and service were at the rendezvous.",
      "Excellent service and amazing food. We ordered several dishes to taste and all of them 10/10. We were told we were ordering too much food for 2 people so they advised us which dishes to remove, which proves they care about customer satisfaction over financial gain. Loyal to the service and the food. The building itself is unique and deserves a mention. Highly recommend if you find yourself in Saigon!",
      "This restaurant is fabulous from the stunning external design, the interior decoration, the interesting menu and the helpful and attentive staff. We had been recommended to this restaurant by some travellers we met in Hoi An. When we got to HCMC we tried to book online but there was no availability. We took a gamble and turned up shortly after opening time and helpfully they managed to fit us in. Ms Nhu Lam patiently helped us through the interesting local menu and we had a chicken with sticky rice under a dome, a beef dish, some greens and from memory we had a rice dish with duck. They really get the attention to detail right without being over fussy. Mr Phuong Vu and his team do a great job!"

It is on the 28th floor so the view is great and the restaurant is decorated nicely. I do think they could choose different type of music with more ambiance, but it is not loud, so this didn’t bother me too much.",

We came for the omakase experience and it was around $100 per person which was reasonably priced and the food was delicious. I thought it was little at first but by the time we finish the whole tasting, I was so full. Hung, our server, was very attentive and took good care of us. My husband loved it and we would come back next time we are in the city.",
      "A very upmarket dining experience in a private Japanese dining room just for the two of us (yes, shoes had to come off before entering, tatami mats everywhere). We could order from two menus one Japanese “Towa”, the other Cantonese “Lai”. We started off with an incredible sashimi spread prepared by Towa’s chef before moving onto a selection of Cantonese dishes from Lai and finished up with a huge bowl of fruit. There is also a great selection of teas available by the pot in the Towa drinks menu if like me, that is your preference over alcohol. Tonight a perfect pot of black Oolong tea was a great match to the cuisine. Faultless service, Delicious food, Great atmosphere. What else could you ask for?"

      "A friend recommended this place to us and said \"it's the best Banh Mi you'll ever have\" and he was not wrong! As we turned onto the street we saw two large queues - one was JUST for delivery drivers to pick up for take out/delivery, and one was for people on foot to takeaway. We knew from the queues it must be good! They don't have a menu as it's just one option - again - sign of someone who knows what they're doing vs a jack of all trades and master of none. Queue was big but wait wasn't long bas they have such a good system and production line going on in there! Can't remember exactly the cost but think around $3USD or something equally as cheap for what really could've been split between two not just for one person! They give you the bread with various cuts of meat with the pate and mayo wrapped up, and then little bags of the salad bits to add inside (1 x cucumber, 1 x pickled radishes, 1 x spring onions and herbs). I honestly can't describe how tasty the whole combo was! Gotta try it!",
      "The French bread, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, is crispier, fluffier, and softer than the real French bread, which seems to be due to the fact that Vietnamese bread is made from rice flour. I liked this better than the real French bread, which is filled with at least five different kinds of ham, pate, pork char siu, chicken ham, meat floss, onion chips, etc., and vegetables such as fresh cucumber, radish and carrot namasu, pak choi, green onion, fresh chilies, etc., are served separately and can be topped according to your preference. Vegetables such as fresh cucumber, radish, carrot, pak choi, green onion and fresh chili are served separately and can be topped as desired. The price is reasonable and the food is too good to be true."

      "Very delicious local food and great service. Super attentive and helpful. In particular Nu, an exceptional waitress. Everything is very clean and, in addition, a very very beautiful decoration of the land. Air conditioning is appreciated. Super attentive and different dishes: transparent lobster rolls, purple rice with shrimp and chicken with lemon sauce, highly recommended. This is the only reason I would go. And a delicious coffee. It is not the cheapest but the price is worth it. I recommend it.",
      "We decided almost at the end of our holiday. In Vietnam to treat ourselves to a dinner in one of the best and elegant restaurants in Saigon. The restaurant is located in the center, a stone's throw from the best hotels and tourist attractions of the city. The location, although a little dated, is very elegant with crystal booths with colored inlays. The menu includes typical local dishes with dishes not so dissimilar from others tasted in other restaurants, I ordered a classic as a starter, Fresh Rolls with prawns and pork followed by a duck breast cooked in two ways with tomato and pepper sauce with bok choi and smashed potatoes, both very elegant dishes and truly excellent on the palate. The service is absolutely professional, you are accompanied and followed right from the moment you enter the room. Naturally the prices are much higher than the Vietnamese average, absolutely normal for us Italians",
      "Having the opportunity to enjoy the anniversary special course dinner was truly wonderful. On previous visits to Vietnam, my schedule never aligned, so I was thrilled to finally seize the chance to dine there this time. Each course was a masterpiece, meticulously crafted and beautifully presented. While it wasn’t inexpensive compared to typical prices in Vietnam, I believe it was a unique and memorable experience worth every penny. The servers were highly professional and impeccably trained, contributing to what was, in every way, a perfect dining experience."

      "Perfect quiet restaurant amidst the hustle and bustle with extremely nice staff and very delicious food. I didn't know I ordered a dish to be rolled with rice paper, but my waiter Jack taught me that well. A clear recommendation !",
      "What a delightful surprise find this restaurant is! Fresh and delicious ingredients - the seafood! - at a ridiculously cheap price. Serving sizes are also very generous. The food more than compensates for basic surroundings. Limited English skills from the very hospitable staff counteracted by pointing at menu (in English and on website) and Google translator. Part of the adventure being the only non-locals there! After our first visit, we brought decent wine glasses and wine. No corkage, they provide an ice bucket. Perfection!",
      "This was our revisit after our last visit in 2019 (before Covid19) and that left us great impression and so decided to revisit again. The restaurant is located in De Tham street, where many family restaurants are located. If you are a first time visitor, you maybe spoiled for choice which restaurant to visit as all look \"good\"! For us, without hesitation, we went to this restaurant. And surprisingly it was quite empty although it was 7.30pm in the evening. Only 2 tables were occupied (on 2nd storey, including ours). Think Covid19 has hit hard on the small and medium businesses here. We ordered the pork ribs with fried rice, BBQ clams, stir fried cauliflowers and water spinach and deep fried chicken. We didn't order the BBQ oysters and beef dishes as we just had them the night before and wanted something \"light\". Portions were huge, And the food were yummy, well marinated and cooked to perfection, consistently good no doubt in that! And prices were reasonable too, despite of inflation, the price did not rise or rise slightly like 5000 dong only. Our dinner at around 220,000 dong. We didn't order any drink as we had plan to visit a cafe for iced beverages as the weather was warm. And it took us 10mins via Grab to get back to Saigon Center for our drinks then!"

Every visit feels special, like stepping into a familiar place filled with delicious food and heartfelt hospitality. The dim sum here is simply perfect—char siu bao is soft and flavorful, the pastries are crisp and golden, and every bite is crafted with authentic flavors. The service is truly five-star, with staff who are always welcoming and attentive, making us feel valued and at home. Whether for a celebration or a casual brunch, Libai never disappoints. It’s more than just a restaurant; it’s a cherished tradition where love, family, and great food come together. For the best dim sum in HCM, this is the place to be!",
      "The service of \"Man\" is good and today we had a nice night with family. Duck is delicious and the atmosphere is good. About $50 per person. Mega Members also enjoy a 10% discount. If you stay here, it is recommended to eat.",
      "A wonderful dim sum buffet. Lot of choice and amazing quality. Maybe the best one in HCMC. And quite affordable during the week. And if you are lost regarding the extended menu, the team can advise you on the dim sum relevant to your taste. And by the way, the main dishes, apart from the dim sum, are quite tasty too."

      "We dined at The Deck Saigon in Thao Dien recently and while the food was satisfying, we found the pricing and service to be disappointing. Despite being forewarned by some locals, my wife and I decided to give it a shot. The riverside seating offered a pleasant ambience, but the service left much to be desired. The main drawback here is the prices, considering that similar quality can be found with service to match. It wasn’t bad service, just inattentive and seemed to not know the menu. We are willing to give it another shot in the future to see if the experience improves. Everybody has off days.",
      "Well worth the short trip through the suburbs, The Deck offers a stunning example of intelligent \"fusion\" cuisine with a perfectly orchestrated mix of local (pancakes or spring rolls ) and Western classics ( carpaccios or ceviches). The impeccable service is in tune with the flawless freshness of all the products. Everything, including the bread and amuse-gueules, was delicious. The team in the kitchen got an unanimous approval from our group of six seasoned travellers who all chose different dishes. Surrounded by magnificent orchids, we enjoyed the peaceful view of Saigon River at our feet, as the meal progressed so smoothly that we forgot for a moment that Saïgon was re-baptized nearly 50 years ago. The Paris of the East is still well alive in many places across the city and this is definitely one of them . Heartfelt congratulations."

      "Have a chance to have lunch here with your family. The space is decorated modernly and luxuriously. My family ordered the set menu - Vietnamese food including 1 salad, 1 stir-fried vegetable, 3 salty dishes, 1 soup. The food is seasoned very well, the family really likes the braised fish dish - suitable for entertaining after the Tet season with braised eggs and meat. Seating space is available indoors and outside at noon, from evening outside, very suitable for romantic dates. The reception and service staff are very enthusiastic. My family and I went to the room that they helped us arrange to sit in the VIP room, and Duyen served our family wholeheartedly throughout the afternoon today.",
      "Last Saturday morning, my girlfriend and I went to have breakfast at ROS restaurant. We accidentally found out about the restaurant because we took the Water bus in District 1. The two of us ordered shrimp noodle soup and beef pho. The noodle soup is delicious, the broth is light, rich in shrimp flavor but a bit off for me. Beef pho is served in a stone bowl so the broth stays hot, has a strong flavor of cinnamon and anise, and is quite delicious. In particular, I find the milk coffee here delicious because I like to drink strong, sweet, bitter coffee. However, because the morning is quite sunny, I think sitting indoors will be cooler and less glare. If I have a chance, I will come back again.",
      "I came one afternoon waiting for my friends to start dinner. Since you haven't arrived yet, I decided to sit at the bar to enjoy a cocktail. Right at happy hour, it's only 89k per drink. The drinks recommended by the bartenders are very suitable to my taste, they are very enthusiastic and fun. After that, I moved to the river bank to have dinner. The food is delicious and unique, there is a slight minus point: I came on the weekend so I had to wait a bit but it's okay, the experience is still very good, the service people are very enthusiastic. Will come back in the near future."

During the day, as temperatures soar and the heavens threaten to open, Cafe de l’Opera becomes a refuge for travellers and the like, just as it always has been since the hotel doors opened in the 50s. Over high-tea, things slow down, friends catch-up, business associates meet and lovers hold hands. By night, things become lively again with tapas, cocktails and wine to the sounds of jazz and the excited chatter of guests enjoying an extended Happy Hour as the city comes alive again.",

I highly recommend visiting this gem in Saigon for a tranquil and inclusive environment that fosters connections.",

Coming here to drink morning coffee, eat a bowl of pho, read a newspaper and look at the street is something worth experiencing. They also have attentive friendly service.

      "Very tasty and well presented dishes served very competently by Oanh. Four diners shared veggie and other dishes and all were more than satisfied. Wine was reasonably priced and we enjoyed eating outdoors in this very busy restaurant. Hard to find but worth looking for.",
      "Been to this restaurant twice on a business trip. It's a little hard to find without special knowledge ) but eventually figured out the location. In the evening you usually need a reservation, but we were lucky and waited no more than 5 minutes . Good service, waiters give good advice on choosing and eating some special dishes. Pleasant atmosphere and interior. And of course, Asian food is delicious.",
      "We had the pleasure of dining at Hoa Túc during our recent trip to Ho Chi Minh City, and it was a fantastic experience. We believe we first visited this restaurant 25 years ago, and it’s just as impressive today! Set in a beautifully restored colonial building that once served as an opium refinery, Hoa Túc offers a charming atmosphere and a unique culinary experience. Their concept of “Vietnamese Cuisine with a Contemporary Twist” is both creative and authentic. The Food: • Starters: • Cá thác lác chiên giòn (Crispy featherback fish cakes): Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. • Bò lá lốt (Grilled minced beef wrapped in betel leaf): A standout dish, tender and packed with aromatic spices. • Mains: • Sườn non mật ong nướng (Grilled honey pork ribs): Sweet, savory, and perfectly tender, complemented by pickled shallots and lemongrass. • Cà tím xào sốt sa tế / Cà tím nướng (Eggplant with saté sauce / Grilled eggplant): Both variations were delicious, but the saté sauce added a delightful kick. The Service: The staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely welcoming, which enhanced our overall dining experience. Hoa Túc is a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the vibrant flavors of Vietnamese cuisine in a unique and historic setting. We can’t wait to return!"

      "We found Pasteur Street Craft Beer – Cưa Bắc Taproom & Restaurant on our first night in Hanoi, and ended up coming back multiple times! The beer is fantastic, and the food is just as impressive. They have 16 beers on tap—10 of their signature brews and 6 rotating seasonal options—so there’s always something new to try. On our first visit, I ordered a tasting flight of six beers and loved every single one. My favorites were the Pomelo IPA and the Passion Fruit Wheat Ale, and I could easily sip the Bia Chanh Muối (a low-alcohol salted lime beer) all day long. My husband, an IPA fan, really enjoyed the Session IPA, and we both loved the Double Jasmine IPA. David was incredibly friendly and helpful, encouraging us to explore the different styles and offering great suggestions along the way. The food was awesome, too! The menu is extensive, ranging from burgers and wings (both excellent!) to creative salads and dishes featuring Vietnamese ingredients. Even better—they sell their beer in affordable 1-liter growlers, so you can bring your favorites home. If you love craft beer and great food in a relaxed setting, this spot is a must-visit! If I could give Pasteur Street Craft Beer more than 5 stars, I would!",
      "So much life passing by, great beer...the Blonde was fab but sadly ran out. It would have been 5 stars but the nuts were crap. Sweet otatoe fries were battered but still tasty. Lovely staff.",
      "The atmosphere of this place is great, quite bustling and modern. Some of the beer flavors I tried were delicious. We also had some spicy chicken, which was great. The staff are also very friendly. Overall, this place is bang for our buck"

    "description": "Set in its original colonial décor from the 1920's, La Table du Chef is a subtle journey into fine crafts, paintings, culinary and winemaking arts sourced from Vietnam and France. In the same way that Hermès workshop was once defined as a song of gestures, lovers of haute cuisine are invited to hunt for traces left by the hand's gestures embedded into many aspects of the decoration of the restaurant. This story appealed to two Michelin-star chef Alain Dutournier who had selected La Table du Chef to bring his art of haute cuisine for the first time outside of France. He adheres so intimately to the concept that Alain now personifies the soul of La Table du Chef and his hands are the expression of the highest culinary art. Together with his talented Vietnamese Resident Chef, Dao Van Son, he brings to La Table du Chef the highest standard of excellence in French cuisine, with a touch of Vietnamese taste. In this artistic atmosphere, gastronomes will have a chance to discover an exceptional menu, highlighting the best local and imported products delivered daily, such as Foie Gras from Landes, Truffle from Perigord, Fleur de sel from Guerande, Duct from South Western France, Sapa's honey, Phu Quoc's pepper... These exquisite dishes are carefully paired with the most refined selection of wines to create a memorable culinary experience in the heart of Hanoi's French quarter. The very explanatory wine menu proposes 450 labels from most famous producers of the world, a majority of French wines, as well as wonderful discoveries from Alain Dutournier, all stored in the open cellar on site.",

      "As soon as arrived in Hanoi bt plane my family wanted to eat western food so I reserved lunch in La Table du Chef. As I expected the presentation was excellent and the food was delicious! There was a 3 course special lunch meal for 600,000 and it was more than you can expect for this price. The staff was friendly and offered an excellent desert dish for our son athough he did not order as he was tired and dizzy from his flight. I definitely recommend this to restaurant for a treat during your stay in Hanoi. (Note that it seemed around me there were mostly formal business luncheons and I regret i didn’t wear a more formal atire)"

      "Pho Bo restaurant has delicious and appetizing food, beef is added to the food quite a lot and it is delicious, the seasoning is seasoned to my taste. The broth is quite good and the side dishes are vegetables. They have ready-made spices for everyone to choose and add themselves. However, in my opinion, this restaurant is really not very comfortable, they should change other furniture and equipment and should clean it more. Really hard to choose it to come next time.",
      "We stopped here for lunch and enjoyed the chicken Pho which was excellent. At nearly 6 feet tall it was a struggle for me to sit on the tiny stalls - but sure was worth the effort! It was great to experience traditional food in a traditional no thrills setting. It's a must if you are in the Old Quarter and want some authentic fare. Thank you."

Food was all good: fresh sashimi, grilled saba fish, sushi (many different types of sushi).. Try the cordyceps mushroom hot pot and noodles that come with beef. Even the dessert greek yogurt (with pearl) was delicious. The menu is regularly refreshed with many dishes. Definitely worth a visit. Good value for $20 dinner set per person considering the food quality, service and restaurant setting.",
      "My partner and I were walking in the area and decided to stop at this lovely looking place for food. We were immediately charmed by the great ambiance, fresh sashimis, delicious tuna rolls, incredible service. A total gem!",
      "OMG I had such an amazing experience that I thought this place was a godsend. After visiting our relatives in Eco Park, my family needed something to eat for dinner. Then we stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. The place itself was rather small but tidy with lovely atmosphere. The service was excellent with very accommodating staff. As a sushi snob, I give this place my approval. The food was fresh, super authentic and delicious. The salmon avocado salad is to die for. The bathroom was clean too, so I undoubtedly rate this place a 10/10. So so good, thank you!"

      "I have read many good reviews about this place. I love “black bread” and here in Hanoi, it is hard to get good ones. I went there according to “less busy hour” on one of the web-sites (as I have read it is a busy place; the service may need to improve, etc), which was at 3 pm. As on their face book page, the working hour was from 11am to 10 pm, also having name” Cafe”, I could not believe a man who was their (seems the part of owner family) told me “in Vietnam, every restaurant must have lunch break” and told me to go back. The cafes in my neighborhood are open from the early morning to night, by the way.... “Weill then, please change, as your are open from 11 am to 2pm and 5 pm to 10 pm” as a kindness. At that moment, the lady of the restaurant said “since you have come here, we offer what we have”. Thanks to her, I was able to eat very good black bread and borscht. I have asked only to have black bread as I don’t eat white wheat and I did not them to waste any. But lady insisted. Funny thing is that a person who were in the kitchen quietly told me, “please do not worry, here, nothing would get wasted. This bread will be used as bread crumbs later.” Well... those who eat any fried cutlet, please keep that in mind... For the kindness of the lady, I give 4 stars."

Osaka is a land famous for culinary Kuidaore neighborhood, among them, typically cakes Okonomiyaki and grilled octopus Takoyaki . Currently, Okonomiyaki are specialties, won the love of not only the parts of the country throughout Japan but also foreign tourists. However, it is still considered unique culture, born from the soil of Osaka. Okonomiyaki plump cake, smear mayonnaise, sprinkle seaweed, fish tissue have great taste when enjoyed by Teko. For diners can enjoy delicious cuisine and attractive at Chibo, we always pay attention to the following factors: Mae aji, Naka AIJ, Ato aji, including: Mae aji impression about food and restaurants ; Naka aj: Taste cakes Okonomiyaki, Ato aji: Comment of the customer after eating and left the restaurant. We absolutely do not take any light of it at all! Okonomiyaki pancake dish was strange, not traditional Japanese cuisine, dishes nor Chinese, European dishes. It's great when everyone gathered around the grill, enjoy a hot Okonomiyaki cake, talking incessantly, creating a closed loop inside of the excitement, enthusiasm. We call it an Okonomiyaki conversation (Okonomiyaki communication) and really appreciate it.",

      "I can say Chibo is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Hanoi. Living in Hanoi for a few years, I visited many of the Japanese restarts that are highly recommened in many other webs and apps. Chibo has lots of different options you can choose from, noodles Okonomiyaki, and sushi. I actually order more than 5 menus to satisfy myself haha. I wanna give 5 stars or more if possible",
      "Favorite okonomiyaki in town. Great variety of option in the menu and all tasted amazing so far. Great place for family and children.",
      "Me and my partner been to Chibo in Osaka and had a very bad experience with their service. Now in Hanoi, we decided to give it another shot and were pleased with the experience. The staff is very polite and attentive, okonomiyaki is has a very authentic taste. We were seated in a private cabin so it was quite and cozy. A bit upset that they didn’t cook the food on our grill table, but rather brought a ready made okonomiyaki from the kitchen. But overall, we are happy. Will come back!"

      "My wife chose this place as a surprise to celebrate my birthday, and honestly I'm very glad she did. They have a good selection of the 2 mil vnd set menu, and the atmosphere was very cozy, although the pairing wine would have been a bit better. The best thing was after the meal, the restaurant manager found out that our bill was wrong (we didn't notice we were over charged cuz we were enjoying our time there), and she called my wife to offer a refund. That's what I called a very attentive and wholesome service. Well done guys! I'll be back for sure.",
      "My family of 4 recently had dinner at Studios and the experience was unforgettable. Every dishes has it own color but for me, I particularly enjoyed Pie Tee and Beef Tartare. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the ingredients were fresh and of high quality. The portion size was also perfect, leaving us comfortably full without feeling stuffed. The restaurant itself had a warm atmosphere. The music was at a pleasant volume, allowing us to easily converse. Will coming back and am really excited to see the new menu to try out",
      "The restaurant serves an artistic style combining cuisine and handmade drinks. This is the first time I have experienced this style. The quality of the food is nothing to criticize, and the pairing drinks are also excellent. Compared to such quality, the price is very reasonable. I will definitely come back often."

      "Little restaurant tucked away (sort of) and on the water at West Lake - away from the centre so quieter and cheaper…. Great, simple menu (ie not overfacing with too much complex choice, but hits all the right notes) Great drinks menu (had the first pisco sour I’ve seen out here - and it was excellent!!). Staff were attentive and knowledgable and could t have been the right side of friendly and without being intrusive. Food arrived quickly and was absolutely wonderful - large portions of fresh tasty fare. Would highly recommend",
      "What a find! Neat little place, with air on upstairs if needed. Tortilla chips while not made onsite come out warm, guac is really tasty though a touch more also and cilantro would be awesome. Tacos are excellent!",
      "I strongly recommend their shrimp taco. The tempura fish taco was really good also. A bit strange that they ran out all wine bottles in their list (all 20 kinda types of wines) so we had to buy a bottle at the warehouse nearby. They were nice not to charge us extra fee on outside drinks as usual so we ordered tequila also and it was good. Services was great. Nice ambient to sit outside by the lake. A bit disappointed that the ceviche was not as good as few years ago when they first opened on Tu Hoa."

      "Good coffee. Very friendly service. Spotlessly clean. Salads are outstanding, I tried 3 different ones over the course of my visit. Soup delicious. Western style coffee too. Very fair pricing for a “foreigner” place. I was able to ask for a mango smoothie made with fresh unsweetened milk instead of the usual sweetened condensed milk. Thanks.",
      "- The Food: Super duper awesome and worth the price. The sandwich is carried out in a proper manner with house chips. The menu is balanced and showcases a considerable depth in sandwich's lore. - The Drinks: Cool and do a good job paralleling the food. - Interior Design: It was cool. - Service's Attitude: It was cool. - Location: Somewhat sequestered to the corner, but has a wide space in compensation"

It's like a Vietnamese version of Five Guys or ShakeShack and building our own burgers was great and also cheap. Theres loads of options of what to put inside your burger/sauces/patty/bun as well. Great service and cute little location too. Also, if you visit here, get the rosemary and garlic fries!!! Would recommend for sure!",

A meal for two with a shared desert (we couldnâ€™t fit more into our tummies) and 2 non-alcoholic beverages set us back around VND 450K. Go check it out if you like your burgers and fries."

      "The bar is well placed in a quiet neighborhood. Still suffering the aftermath of the pandemic, need some refurbishment to offer such an Spaniard atmosphere, as the name suggests. Not much customers when we dropped by, Saturday noon. Dishes are small but tasty and well seasoned, bread is outstanding and his owner Rodrigo is a nice guy and used to be around and keeping an eye on everything.",
      "This made a nice change from local cuisine and was a treat. We ordered way too much food but is was all delicious, if ordering a meat platter this comes with bread already so best not to order more bread on the side as you end up with like a loaf, same with the alioli dip, pretty much everything came with this so ordering a side was unnecessary. The Spanish omelette was tasty, cheeae empnadias and mushroom croqueetes were good too. All of the food came out together and well presented, we just know to order less next time! The staff were super friendly and welcoming here also",
      "Great value for money and tasty food. Generous portions. Potatoes a bit too oily. Service staff look depressed, no smile and walking around very sad...owners must be in kitchen but service team need to cheer up."

      "I like the old fashioned. My wife got too many of the signature cocktails and she ran away with another man. I am currently trying to sway her back by brooding at the bar. No amount of cologne has helped.",
      "Classy atmosphere but with great energy. Went with my friends and we had such a fun night. If you are looking for an elegant and unique space (favorite design choice: the giant amber egg hanging overhead) and like grooving along to music from the DJ, it’s a must-try. The space feels cozy and lively. Enjoyable for many age groups.",
      "I went there with my best friends and had a great time. I love the ambience, decoration was impressive. The staffs were very nice and supportive. They managed to give us 2 seat without prior reservation. Overall a very nice experience!"

      "Great little find when we were out walking last night. The food was fresh and tasty for a great price. Service was excellent. We ordered a rice each and nan to share which was a mistake as one portion of rice was big enough for two of us and the nans were individual sized. We would recommend the chicken tikka masala. Will definitely go back before we go home.",
      "Wow, our meal here was absolutely delicious!! We ate the best butter chicken and garlic naan we have ever had!!! Rich and creamy sauce, tender fresh chicken and authentic spices and flavour!!! The rice was perfect and fluffy and the garlic naan was out of this world - cooked perfectly with the freshest garlic embedded in the bread and the dipping sauces took it all to the next level! The restaurant is just around the corner from Hanoi Beer St in the old quarter so a fantastic, vibrant area to wander through. The atmosphere inside and out was great! You can choose to sit outside or inside, ground floor or upstairs where the aircon was perfectly cool! A very high quality yet affordable meal (and drinks) with great service from lovely Indian and Vietnamese staff! If you feel like a change from Vietnamese food on your trip, this is a must try!!!",
      "YOU can’t Go Wrong with The Taj Indian and Vegetarian Restaurant. We started with the samosas which were flaky and not greasy. Nans were like pastry with a good selection of fillings. The vegetable masala was spicy deliciousness, and the spinach was smooth and flavorful. Mahdab, the owner was delightfully friendly and attentive. Priced and portioned for families. I highly recommend a visit at least once during your stay in the Old Quarter, Hanoi. It’s also on a street that is bustling with all sorts of candies, nuts and bottled booze! ENJOY ☺️"

You would find the Japanese family style restaurant. menu is extensive and I guess there are not few chinese or vietnamese mixed disks. the modest lunch sets for single customers are very popular. the foods are generally good. sashimis are quite fresh, mostly from local fish. the prices are on the above average side. the shop looks small outside but quite big inside and very busy at lunch time. better book your table in advance. note that all shoes off entering the shop.

      "Wonderful cooking class at Hao Sua, a vocational school designed to teach teens from poor villages a trade (sewing, embroidery, French cooking, Vietnamese cooking, baking, table service) then places them in local restaurants and hotels post-graduation. Started the day at the local market. Fresh vegetables, spices and meat. Seeing chickens in a cage was bothersome for my 13 year old son and my husband made sure he didn’t see chickens being killed. In retrospect, we should have asked our guide to avoid the meat section of the market although can’t get a more authentic experience. The ingredients for our food had already been bought but we picked up some mangosteen and vegetables. After a quick tour of the school, we made our way to the kitchen. Spent the morning making a delicious papaya salad, fresh spring rolls (rolling them perfectly is definitely an art) and grilled chicken. The chef guided us through the prep and cooking process. After we finished, we sat down at a beautifully set table to our feast. One of the best meals we had on our trip thanks to a great chef. Highly recommend this class as family fun and a great way to learn about Vietnamese food."

      "We ordered from this place a number of times while we were in lock-down for COVID. The food was so good that I really wanted to visit and eat in the restaurant itself. The ambiance isn't much. The dining room is quite small and because it's all concrete, the loud party next to us was quite annoying. And, we saw some of the kitchen staff smoking in the kitchen. Perhaps that's OK in Vietnam but for a westerner, it's a bit of a turn-off. Either way, the food was good. Yes, most of my friends prefer Pizza Belga but I find Belga to be overpriced and \"under-cheesed\" if that's a word. We actually really enjoyed everything we got from Paolo and I hope to return soon.",

      "we eventually got to try Iroha ramen after they opened again after being closed over the recent Tet new year celebrations and it was definitely worth the wait. One of my favourite restaurant dishes is Ramen and having tasted ramen in 5 of the 7 continents I certainly rate Iroha up there with some of the best outside of Japan. The broth was both flavoursome and not too salty, with a nice selection of ingredients. This is a highly recommended ramen restaurant.",
      "Was looking for a quality ramen 🍜 place in Hanoi and stumbled upon Iroha after looking it up. Arrived right after they re-opened for the dinner service, so had the place entirely to myself. The staff were second to none and they were extremely attentive and courteous. Food-wise, I went for the Miso Ramen, which was as good a bowl I could have hoped for. Noodles were spot-on, broth was great, the pork slices were tender and flavorful, and the egg yolk was just as it should be with a gorgeous consistency. Price was a bit high by local standards, but well-worth it if you’re craving the good stuff like it is back in Japan. As someone who lives in this city, I’ll definitely come back for more."

It was not tasty and also ratio of value for money did not exist. They have portraits of many dignitaries who are in this place but perhaps it was a good restaurant in the past. The only highlight for me was life music performance",

      "We happened to walk by this place and thought we saw a sign for Che Thai (Thai fruit dessert) so we came in. Turned out they didn’t have it. But we’re glad we sat down because the coffee is sooo good! Dark and strong and sweet, what real Viet coffee should taste like. I think this is more of a local spot, but if you want strong Viet coffee this is one of the spots to check out (they don’t have egg coffee though, but quite a selection of drinks and dessert drinks. And it’s at a busy intersection so you can sit and enjoy the traffic and people watching.",

The quality of the fresh ingredients (morilles and cepes mushrooms, Japanese wagyu beef etc) was just outstanding. We were brought a whole plate of fresh morilles which are extremely expensive. We were amazed by the profusion of high quality ingredients specially in such quantities for each customer. The resulting hotpot was... Well... The best I have ever had. It was not cheap but certainly worth more than we were charged. Highly recommended",

      "My husband and I had a fabulous seafood dinner at this restaurant during our visit to Hanoi last week. The staff did not speak much English but they were friendly and helpful. We had 2 seafood dishes, the crab in sour sauce and mantis shrimp with garlic and butter and both dishes were excellent. Sauteed morning glory and seafood with glass noodle were both also very tasty. The best part was that they had a promotion for week night dining which made the meal very reasonable (even our tour guide thought so). This restaurant is located a bit away from the main tourist area in the old quarter but definitely worth the trip to get there."

      "Lovely little place in Hanoi - a place with a sophisticated European feel in the hustle & bustle of Hanoi Old Town. We visited a couple of times, once on a Wednesday which is Jazz night - beautiful soft jazz, not too loud, gave the place a lovely atmosphere. Would recommend if in Hanoi Old town - good wines, & though not extensive, the menu has a good selection - can certainly recommend the cheese board. Hope it continues to thrive!",
      "Nice wine bar with a very good selection of wines, delicious cheese and very fresh, crispy baguettes. The music is tailored to European tastes and fits perfectly in this bar. Everything is very pleasant and atmospheric. The bubbling sound with which mucus is drawn up from the nose into the throat is certainly not one of the more pleasant acoustic experiences. Unfortunately, the young bartender doesn't know this and is constantly busy with his slime, which is especially disgusting when you are eating. Unfortunately, the staff is not very friendly to the guests. We were here practically every evening during our stay in Hanoi and the behavior hasn't changed. It's a shame, we would expect that at this price level and in a bar that is obviously aimed at European customers.",
      "This is a proper wine bar in Hanoi. A range of red and white wines by the glass and an extensive wine by the bottle list. Happy hour 4pm to 7 pm with 30% reduction was sadly missed by us but fir top quality wines this is still a great venue The cheese plate was substantial and will be easily sufficient for two Don’t miss Ajax Wednesday. Soft mellow jazz beautifully song and played by two local musicians. Overall this is a place to plan into any trip to Hanoi"

The picturesque lakeside setting and view of Hoan Kiem Lake were certainly major draws for this property. The quality of drinks and food was acceptable, but not exceptional. However, the main negative was the price. I found that the prices were a little too high compared to the quality of the products offered. It's important to note that prices shown on the card do not include taxes and service fees, which may result in a final bill that is higher than expected. The service at Thuy Ta cafe was OK, but not particularly attentive. I would have appreciated an additional touch of friendliness to make the experience more pleasant. Despite these drawbacks, the lakeside location was lovely, and the place was conducive to relaxation. It's a nice place to have a coffee or a snack while enjoying the beautiful view of the lake.",
      "Beside good service and tasty vietnamese food, this restaurant is “must visit” place in Hanoi due to its location! I love the view toward Hoan Kiem Lake! Amazing"

The The food was good, my suggestion is to stick to the salads, appetizers and pizza. The service is very good, staff there were very friendly. Check it out.",
      "Interesting and fun place.. A pool table for added fun. There’s plenty of space to sit outside surrounded with greenery. We had pizza & fries which were tasty.",
      "This place was a great find whilst here in Hanoi with my work for 6 weeks. Thursday nights they do mussels in a fantastic tomato and garlic baste - very tasty. They do wood fired pizzas and various other foods, which are delicious. Not local Viet food, but not over priced either. Very friendly team there and always happy to help. We went on Thursday night 19/12 for mussels. Last night for pizza and beers. We will be back tonight again."

      "We went to the Oak Wine Boutique yesterday. Love that the entrance is down an alley and up some stairs. We sat on the balcony above the fray and enjoyed a glass of white wine while the city bustled below. Some friends joined us for dinner- lamb chops, steak and noodles shared between us - and of course more wine. The service was great, very friendly and just close enough. Also the music was so nice, all of us remarked on it - jazz, but did not compete with the conversation. ☺️"

We were very pleasantly surprised by how friendly the service was and how tasty our pizzas were! It was a hit! We can recommend the \"Paolo & Chi Pizzeria\" without hesitation.",

      "This is an amazing experience in a special place that looks more like a living room than a commercial restaurant. 10 minutes taxi ride from the old city, this is a residential area and the restaurant is hided behing a wall that conceals a beautiful garden and villa. We sat at the bar which allows for full view of what happens in the open kitchen. The tasting menu is balanced, very special and based on local produce and Vietnamese ingredients. Everything was so beautifully presented and the taste was always subtle and yet exciting. The price is also friendly for what you get so it is a highly recommended experience when in Hanoi. DONT MISS IT !",

Had I ordered both the pizza and pasta, it would have been far too much food.  The salad bar was incompletely stocked at 1:30 PM but what I found was good.  The \"spaghetti bolognaise\" didn't taste a bit like what you'd find in Italy and had a tomato-based sauce that resembled what would come from a bottle of Ragu.  My partner had a BBQ beef pizza that was \"okay.\"  The total bill with two bottled waters was 387,720 VND (about $16).\n\nDespite only an average experience at lunch, the easy option appealed to us again several days later for dinner.  We split a large Hawaiian pizza that was good but not great.  With three local beers, the charge was 337,000 VND (about $14).  Service for both meals was good but not polished.  We sensed tension between the wait staff and their manager.\n\nThe menu is extensive and extends far beyond pasta and pizza.  The other diners were mostly local, and at dinner included families enjoying huge platters of ribs and other western items.

The 2nd visit, we ordered the large split(Hawaiian/Marinara) thin crust pizza, Lime Drink, Zero Heiniken, then caramel dessert and apple crisp with ice cream. Excellent food and service with both bills under $19. Noise level is high especially with families on the weekends.",

      "Really great place. We came here by a group of 4 hugry people after 8h of walking around city and we recived even to much food to eat all of it. Prices are really fair, from my point of view, and personel is really friendly. Only one thing to notice - noodles = soup, but it was great, so who cares XD",
      "We went twice it was that good, owner is so so so lovely gave us free bananas as dessert. Food was great, we had the steamed chicken both times it was that delicious. Good prices too compared to similar places around the old quarter and very generous portions. Cafe is small and cozy sealed off from the busy road so less noise, good air con, very clean. In summary just eat all your meals in Hanoi here",
      "We had walked around trying to find a small cafe restaurant that wasn’t eating on the side of the road. They were friendly, good the best we had whilst on our stay in Hanoi and with wifi and a good fan, it was perfect. We ate bbq pork and seafood dishes with noodles"

      "5 minute walk from both the Sheraton and Intercontinental hotels. The food quality, selection, and presentation are excellent. The prices are extremely reasonable. We started with duck pate matched with a variety of breads. We were served an amuse bûche of beef relish. Hummus was provided to go with the bread baskets. I ordered a set menu of spring rolls, duck confit, and crème brûlée. My partner ordered the fish and panna cotta. We loved everything. They have an extensive wine cellar, VERY reasonably priced. The meal was excellent and the staff were very attentive and engaging with a good command of English. The decor is beautiful - brick walls with a selection of modern paintings. We had a table by a very large window so we could watch Hanoi nightlife while we ate. I recommend the Vine to anybody staying in the area."

      "I visited the branch in Hanoi for a quick lunchtime snack and I sat at the bar. The atmosphere was decent, probably very cool for a romantic nighttime meal. Prices are relatively high for such in Hanoi but compared to Western prices it is pretty cheap. Food quality is good and fresh. I personally like the chefs to wear gloves so that their skin does not touch my raw fish, although I am well aware of the for and agains on this.... Still, if you like the gloves ON this is not necessarily the place for you. They bring very small amounts of ginger and they served no wasabi which I thought a tad strange, although to be fair - when I asked they did bring what I needed very fast. Services is distant but decent. The place is worth a visit.",
      "Was there with my family twice in January 2017 and May 2017. The ambiance was great and the service was decent. The food was alright, nothing spectacular though. To sum it up, the quality of the food does not match the price and I think there are better Japanese places to put your money."

      "Got back to Hanoi late after a day trip and the restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed. Walked around the corner and found Gecko. It's a find! I think I had ribs with mashed potato (of all things!) and the potato was the best I had ever tasted, really! My friends had a rice dish and a noodle dish which were all really tasty and the cost was amazingly low. We had beers too. Sadly it was our last night in Hanoi or we would have returned to sample the other dishes on the menu. The staff were friendly and the delivery of the dishes was prompt. Really great place to eat in Hanoi, and easily found.",
      "I had the chicken and sweetcorn soup which was nice and creamy, although it didnt come with bread so had to pay extra for that. My boyfriend ordered meatballs which came with rice, the sauce was more like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce and he found it too sugary and salty so didnt eat much. We both enjoyed our shakes though."

We ordered the classic dim sum dishes with a vegetable stir fry and sweet and sour pork - all delicious! I would most certainly recommend this restaurant for those seeking an alternative cuisine in Hanoi!",
      "We been there before on normal days they serve the dimsum in the chinese restaurant. This time we went for their buffet Dimsum and they have alot more choices spread over the open area on 2nd floor. They serve and go around using the traditional carts and the food quality is still good! Will definitely be back again.",

      "Right from the entrance one is made welcome and relaxed. Was introduced to available snakes. The cobra supposidely tastier is much bigger enough for several people. I chose the Bamboo snake small enough for one person. You get to see the culling including swollowing the beating heart infused in snake blood Vodka. Several shots of that and the eight course meal kept coming. Couldn't eat the whole thing but a worthwhile Experince 3.5 for me",
      "We just wandered here on our own a little after lunch time as the last of the customers were leaving and staff had already started cleaning yet they were ready to serve us. There was a lone English speaking staff who explained the process. We opted for a cobra which was cooked into 10 different dishes. The blood n bile were mixed with rice wine to have as shots. Food was tasty and service was ok. The only thing amiss was the heart was not still beating when being served. A little tricky to find. We booked an uber and asked the staff to explain the address. The uber guy cancelled - the reason could be the alleys or maybe the staff wanted to arrange their transporation...finally we walked out onto the main street and booked another uber."

      "We ordered the sous vide rib eye steak . Instead of the blue cheese sauce we asked for black pepper sauce. No problem. We had the best , juicy steak I have had for a long time. It was cooked to perfection - medium rare and the grill marks added extra flavor. Fabulous. It came with some small potatoes and a tiny carrot. A few more vegetables would have been ideal. The white Riojas wine was outstanding. Little acidity. It was quiet in the restaurant that it was easy to talk. Service was excellent. Could not fault. Can recommend",
      "I think \"Casa Espana\" is the best Spanish restaurant in Hanoi. Lunch set menu (attached photo) was reasonable price and each dishes were very tasty. I tried other set menu as well and they served us cold cuts board, 3 tapas and main dish. If you will go there, I recommend you to drink Barcelona Beer at same time. Enjoyed their food and atmosphere, that's why I give them 5* rating. Thanks Casa Espana."

      "A very good Japanese restaurant, not for all budgets but so good. Very warm welcome, the cuisine is simply perfect and fresh, the chef explains each dish to you in English. I recommend it, if you like Japanese cuisine, go there with your eyes closed",
      "What an incredible Japanese dinner, an artwork of food. The chefs were precise and thoughtful preparing everything before our eyes with presentation you could only dream of. The master chef went out of his way to describe the dishes and ingredients in his best English too. Many raw fish and egg dishes, exquisite flavours. The staff were attentive. Dinner was fine dining, $300 AUD for two. Our international Mastercard did not work in their eftpos machine and so we then paid cash, but the attitude to the eftpos error (out of our control) was not pleasant for us. An unfortunate end to an incredible experience. I do recommend going but encourage taking cash.",
      "This place was amazing, and not only for the food. We ordered the omakase and were treated to a lavish and elegant feast with over the top presentations of each course. My friend paid for the meal and I paid for a pricey bottle of sake. We couldn’t finish all the sake but we put enough of a dent in it that I was definitely tipsy by the end of the meal. I meant to leave fifteen dollars over the service charge as tip but mixed up the bills and left $80 instead. I only discovered this when I returned to my hotel. I was annoyed with myself but I didn’t think there was anything I could do. The next day, I was wandering around Hanoi rather aimlessly and I found myself in front of the restaurant. I thought, why not? And I politely told them I thought I had left too much money the previous night. They immediately said yes, I had. And they promptly returned the money I had given them minus the amount I had intended to tip them. I gave them half that amount again for being so honest and kind. I apologized for my mistake but they assured me it was okay. They have certainly earned the tip, the 5 stars, and my gratitude."

We tried the beef and cheese rolls, beef steak with mushrooms, chef’s salad, Al Fresco salad, and the chocolate brownie with ice cream. Strongly recommend. Very kind and precise staff with very good understanding of English (unlike some other places).",
      "Delicious pizza! I've eaten at Domino's and Pizza company and found Alfresco's food to be a bit better than the above two restaurants. The space is clean and has a bit of a restaurant feel. There are also often promotions of 99k. Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't have as many facilities as other pizzerias"

      "Came here for a social group gathering as it was arranged for the group to have twas and coffees upstairs. This was my first visit and the restaurant is delightful, very well decorated and welcoming staff. We were fortunate enough to have a welcome from the restaurant manager who clearly has a high passion for his work and in particular tea, will be returning for a tea tasting session for sure. The upstairs had a large open patio balcony area and was very chic in design. You could also peel at the open kitchen as you walked down to the ground floor. Looking forward to returning",
      "Enjoyable dinner time alone. Very friendly waiter always with warm smile on face. Also introduce the better view on roof top, but a abit hot for me eventually i stayed indoor. Very nice food in reasonable price. Fancy dish arrangement as well. Perfect portion size for me. I ordered: Green salad Salmon tartar Onion rings Mojitos All good! Unfortunately not able to take any images having non stop facetime call with my hubby 🙈 Definitely will go again for next stay. ==================================== 但點解要我打中文呢…. 明明打好晒英文但唔計字數，係要我寫無聊50字呀。 呢間係幾舒服，今日晚機走，依家check out 完都會過去坐下先過機場",

Weds they have a happy hour(s) menu which is longer for the ladies, this was a great opportunity to sample a few of the wines in one evening.

They decided to make it specially for him. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who visits Hanoi.",

      "I was visiting museums around the Opera House and looking for a place for lunch. This place wasn't actually on my radar, I was looking out for a couple of other highly-rated restaurants when I saw this place. It looked good from the outside, so I went in. This restaurant didn't disappoint. The food was every bit as good as in any good Japanese restaurant I've been to (and there have been quite a few, both in Japan and outside). I was a little bit hesitant ordering the fish bento, being unsure about the quality of sashimi in Hanoi. But the sashimi was totally fresh and well-prepared, as good as any sashimi I've tried. Importantly, they have a very good sake list, with plenty of options available in 180 and 300 mL flasks. It was a most delightful lunch that made my museum tour that extra bit more fun. By the way, the location of this restaurant is slightly mis-labelled on the map: It is actually right at the side of the large square building with an internal courtyard housing the History Museum.",
      "Last week, I came here on sunday night. The restaurant was crowded. So lucky that we meet the server staff who was kind and enthusiastic . Though the restaurant was crowded, the staff was still willing to help us to order menu and recommend delicous food. We waited a long time, however they were sorry to have kept us waiting. It is so nice! Food is so good I love japanese food I love your restaurant",
      "I love your restaurant so much I came here to be drunk with my friends. The atmosphere is animated and your food is so yummy. The staff is enthusiastic Recommendation for you who want to find a chill space Let the music runs to you Let the alcohol flows into you Sit and enjoy all !!!"

      "Clean, tasty, genuine home cooked food. My husband and son eat meat so weren’t as enthusiastic as me about going vegan. To their total delight they loved their meals as much as me! The pho was outstanding - rich flavours with tofu/tempeh and rice noodles that appeared to be homemade rather than mass produced. The spring rolls were equally flavoursome, crispy and not too oily. We also had a plate a perfectly ripe jackfruit for dessert . Great service . Good quality food . Highly recommend.",
      "By coincidence, passing to see West lake, we saw vegan choice for lunch. Small street restaurant, friendly owner, decent offer. Ambience is not super nice but taste and offer was good and interesting and enjoyed it. Ordered noodle soup, steamed rice with veggies and fried spring rolls. Recommended",
      "Our favorite restaurant in Hanoi. The vegan food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We had a Pho dishes which featured various vegan meats and a noodle dish. As we would be on the road the next day, we ordered strips of fried fake meat which was perfect for our packed lunch. Wish we could have tried everything!"

Suitable for a formal business meeting as well as casual gathering for there are so many private rooms including VIP room which will guarantee your companies an impressive moments. Surely no more words for the food. Exactly the authentic taste of Korea - and you should try pyeongyang langmyeon(cold soup noodle) which is a nice desert-like food after having rich BBQ meal. Restaurant itself is also very clean - which I really think is important.",

In my opinion, this restaurant is good for you to welcome the foreigner customer, the dishes here is definitely Vietnamse style, it makes the foreinger feel exciting and eager to taste the food. I can see the comfort in my business customer's eyes whenever I had dinner with them here. Finally, the price is expensive, just for business purpose.",
      "We came for an early dinner about 6pm and prior to going in we checked regarding Pho and they confirmed they had it and the quantity of meat roughly in each bowl. When we were seated and decided our meal, the waitress took our order and brought us our drinks and then later came and said that they ran out of Pho soup!! I am not sure how a restaurant of this size could run out of Pho soup at 6pm!! On top of this they could not offer pineapple juice even though it is on the menu. We ended up ordering pork chops but the meat was all cut up and was quite dry - very disappointing. The restaurant looked quite nice but food was very average and on the pricey side."

      "Six of us staying at the Hanoi-Sofitel Legend Metropole wanted a Vietnamese restaurant close by for our first night in Hanoi. Club Opera Novel was on the hotel recommended list so we all tried it. There is a nice ambience in the restaurant and a couple of the wait staff spoke English. The Fried Spring rolls were a great surprise and were served pegged by toothpick to a hollowed out pineapple illuminated by a candle beneath. The rolls were outstanding and crunchy. I highly recommend this appetizer! I had the fried sea bass which turned out to be fish medallions fried with a nice sauce. It was just okay. My other friend chose the steamed Grouper in tea leaves which she enjoyed. As a side we ordered the eggplant which I thought had too much sauce. Nevertheless the eggplant tasted good. In summary, this is s good restaurant with a good variety. The only issue I had was that four of us received their dinner but mine took another 15 min. Prices are 4 star but the quality is good.",
      "We ate here twice during our brief stay in Hanoi. The first time was lunch and we were the only people in there. We tried the spring rolls (crab/pork) and the Imperial style, pho, glass noodle with crab and Australian beef stir fry. Then for dinner with another couple and once again everything was delicious. Service was lovely too."

      "Found by chance and ordered chicken noodles and shrip fried rice with a Hanoi beer and diet coke. Food came steaming hot from the kitchen, served with a smile and tasted great. Sjrimps like king prawns and chicken super tender. Came to £8.50! Enough for 2 to share. Highly recommended!",
      "We found this great family run restaurant just off the night market. It offers excellent value for money and all the dishes we tried were wonderful and full of flavour. Service was quick and friendly. I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointed.",
      "The servings are a good size and great value. The shredded chicken salad comes with peanuts on top and was delicious. Sometimes the service was great but one time we ordered 2 dishes, only 1 turned up and when we asked about the 2nd it still didn't turn up so we gave up and left. Still worth going again then we discovered another V-Cuisine just around the corner (29 P. Hàng Giầy, Hàng Buồm, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội, Vietnam) with the same menu and more reliable service."

We ordered a few different dishes and each one was delicious! The crab pasta here makes me impressed. It’s the first time we tried to eat a whole crab, even its skin. It’s fantastically delicious and I really liked it. Highly recommend!",
      "We really enjoyed our fine dining here. Food and wine all lovely and well cooked. We especially loved the squid dish and the yummy chocolate lava cake. Only downside was they didn’t serve tea or coffee after the meal which is quite a disappointment as we had to leave and go to another cafe just for a meal end drink!"

In addition, the shop also sells egg coffee that I always want to try. At first, I thought putting eggs in the coffee would have a fishy smell, but it's not fishy, it's quite fragrant, a unique flavor. I also saw the shop listed in the menu of chrysanthemum tea drinks, they put dried chrysanthemums and a few other ingredients I don't know what it is but it looks very beautiful and luxurious.",

    "description": "In our group there were trip members who prefer Indian food even during travelling abroad. Aahar was the answer and this eatery was just few meters away from our hotel. So, we ordered and enjoyed butter and garlic nan, dal makhani, panner tikka, butter chicken, mixed vegetable, and what not. All the group members enjoyed quality and tasty typical Indian style dishes thoroughly. Finally, we'd masala tea to wrap the session. It was truly a pleasant experience not just for the quality of food and ambiance, but also service of staff. Sensed they try their best to satisfy travelers. Price is also reasonable and so South Asian tourists should try this place for having quality food of their own taste.",

      "The garlic naan was truly delicious, hot and piping, paired perfectly with the rich flavors of paneer butter masala and fried rice. During the rainy season, the masala chai at this place felt like a true blessing. Conversation with the restaurant owner added a special touch to the overall experience. Dining here was really enjoyable!",
      "Aahaar restaurant, located in Old Quarters of Hanoi, gives you an experience of Indian food away from home. Since this restaurant was near our hotel, we used to visit it when craving home food. The quality of the food is excellent both in taste and presentation. They maintain perfect hygiene. The lady who runs the restaurant, Lan, is very hospitable and enquires at each table about the well being of guests. Even the price is reasonable. Try their daal fry, rolls, chicken curry, naan and keema matar."

      "My husband and I were so lucky to find this Bánh Mì place in Hanoi's Old Quarter. It is a little off the beaten track and we only happened onto it while shopping for traditional Vietnamese sweets across the street. We tried two different types of Bánh Mì which were both delicious as I am sure everything else is in this restaurant. All ingredients are fresh and tasty. The shop owner is very nice as is her son who speaks English and who sometimes helps out his mother. I hope to go back one day to try the other things on the menu. There are other Bánh Mì places closer to the cathedral, but this one is by far superior.",
      "this is my first experience about banh mi. it was so good, the bread is so soft and other toppings are perfect. and I had 2 drinks cuz so hot weather, they are nice too. avocado rich taste and kind of lemon things make me feel fresh. also very nice staff who can speak English so well.",
      "This is the best banh mi in Hanoi for me! I’ve tried Banh Mi 25 as it’s super hyped up by others and while Banh Mi 25 is good, Banh Mi Vui beats them when it comes to toppings and quite frankly Banh Mi Vui tastes just as good if not even better than Banh Mi 25. Also, their milk iced coffee is the best! Definitely my favorite banh mi and iced coffee in Hanoi. If you’re reading this review please come and try it. I love their beef with mozzarela cheese banh mi."

We were shown to our table by a young girl who had limited English and saw only one other person the whole evening - a young lad that came in and went upstairs to what I presume was the kitchen and then wandered back outside again. We had the honey chicken having read about it on TA but this was thigh chicken and most of the flavour was on the skin which I don't often eat so lacking in taste for me. Had sticky rice which was okay but nothing special. We had spring rolls to start - a few small pieces in very nice sauce though. Finished with banana fritters which were lovely - in syrup with peanuts. Whole meal was 410,000 VD. There was no atmosphere and the girl spent the whole night on her mobile phone texting and talking. We were there about an hour and were really disappointed.",

      "I came here many years ago and had the best chicken I had ever eaten. After seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's show, I was fortunate to come and try the chicken cooked by madam Tuyet herself. Unfortunately now the charm has gone. It's still run by the Tuyet family but clearly the desire to be the best is not as important now and the restaurant is empty. Such a pity. I hope they read trip advisor and take this as constructive feedback. The same chicken I ordered years ago that I have told so many people was the best ever is now just ok.",
      "Another great recommendation that we got. Went here and found the place. The entrance (and walk up to the restaurant) isn't much but the food was great. We asked for suggestions and the choices were great. A must visit."
