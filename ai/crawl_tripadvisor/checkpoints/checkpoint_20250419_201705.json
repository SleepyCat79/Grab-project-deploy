Ours is an inspirational story. Founding owner and group Chairman, Nguyen Van Duy, and his team dreamt of building a professional boutique Spa group founded on superb customer service. Working hard, knowing how to take risks, natural instinct and sheer love of creating wonderful luxurious memories exceeding expectations were, and are our trademark. The challenging early days were made harder due to limited funds. Plus, our team was very young, trying hard to introduce a new concept into a competitive Spa market. But, our passion, open-minded approach, and unfailing determination paid off. Working 24/7 we laid LSG’s foundations and set a new trend for the Spa industry. Our goal is to consistently give every guest outstanding personal service from the heart focusing on sophistication, luxury.",

Working hard, knowing how to take risks, natural instinct and sheer love of creating wonderful luxurious memories exceeding expectations were, and are our trademark. The challenging early days were made harder due to limited funds. Plus, our team was very young, trying hard to introduce a new concept into a competitive Spa market. But, our passion, open-minded approach, and unfailing determination paid off. Working 24/7 we laid LSG’s foundations and set a new trend for the Spa industry.",

The support is really very pleasant.\nWhile drinking some tea, first fill out a small sheet of paper to describe your current state (tired, stressed, etc.)\nYou can choose to personalize your ritual etc. I think all of this can be done on the iPad when entering the cabin because once you have everything done, you will enter the cabin and confirm everything with my esthetician. described on the form. I see that this is duplicated. Then when it was time for the ceremony, I was left alone for an Ayurvedic massage. I loved my treatment, yen was very professional, very meticulous and she took the time to check that everything was going well during the treatment (temperature, massage pressure, zones) It's perfect! Thank you very much 🥰\nI will come back with great pleasure because this was a very good massage ritual, I will try other treatments, thank you again 🧘‍♀️ I really recommend!\"",

Chef Hung Pickle chatted with us to understand our preferences and swapped banh xeo for spring rolls. We started the beef stock, and while the stock was simmering, we went out to the market. The short ride to the market was another small sightseeing experience for us! The market tour was interesting and we bought a few things there for our future use as well. We learned a lot of tips from Chef Hung (beyond foreign cookbooks), and we feel confident to remake the dishes back home. In fact, we plan to cook the dishes this coming weekend while our memory is fresh! ðŸ˜¹",

      "description": "It is 100km from Wuse2/central abuja. The Road is well tarred to gurara, aside a 3km stretch midway, which took 20mins to navigate. Total Journey time on powerbikes was 90mims to and 70mins back. Always quicker returning!!The PROSThe waterfall itself is an amazing tourist location and best enjoyed as a group. Pack ur own food and drinks as there isnt much at the location to feast upon. Danjuma the tour guide was brilliant. He was patient, knows the best spot for great pix, very helpful in helping u navigate the terrain and he takes excellent pix, if you hand him your phone/camera.The walking and dipping under the cascading waterfall lasted about two hours. Then another one hour recovering before riding back to abujaThere are several other things enroute that u may wish to stop for such as farmers market, Zuma rock (watch out for the monkeys that will pelt u with rocks if u tried climbing too high on to Zuma). A slight detour also takes you into the popular suleja market. So set off early. Its potentially a full day of activities.The CONS:If driving, check traffic updates very well before setting off.  Zuba and Madalla traffic was horrible the day we went due to road works.  Felt pity for those in cars. We rode, thankfully! The location is also poorly signed posted. Infact, the only signage was at the entrance (97km from our departure point). So if you dont have google map, u will have to keep asking.The guys at the gate also extort. They charged us N2k each as entrance fee, with no receipt issued. I guess Niger State govt dont need the revenue. Meant to be N500 apparently but having travelled that far, we had no choice. Still worth the 2k, if receipted!!",

      "description": "I booked this for a private event for 18 guests (male & female) on a Friday before my friend's wedding.  It was amazing!  I coordinated the private booking from the US via WhatsApp and used google translate to assist.  It was an easy process.  The coordinator was friendly and responsive to my questions given the time difference.  As a private party we had the facility to ourselves which included access to the indoor/outdoor thermal pools.  We organized various package services listed on the website and lunch served in the overlooking veranda (both based on each of the 18 people's specific service/drink package and lunch request which we provided in advance).  When we arrived, we were greeted and shown into the locker rooms for changing.  The facility was clean and had an attendant for the ladies room.  Robes & sandals were provided as well as secure lockers for the ladies. The bar staff was very attentive and quick to replenish our beverages.  The Thermal baths were wonderful.  The water was warm, clear, and clean.  The indoor thermals have an outside nook where the bar is located.  The grounds surrounding the facility had beautiful manicured landscaping & gardens around the outdoor pool and veranda.  There are lounge chairs available for sunbathing in the outdoor pool area.  We reserved the space for 6 hours (10am - 4pm).  They were able to accommodate the 17 people (one opted out of a massage and just enjoyed the thermals) who requested massages using 4 massage therapists in 2 rooms that can service 2 people at a time using a curtain divider.   The main course lunch options were Arrachera or Chicken breast with a salad appetizer and custard dessert.  All of which was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  I chose this location specifically because it does not allow children. This place is fantastic and I would absolutely book a private event with them again. I cannot recommend the Mayan Baths more highly!",

The bustling shopping mecca of Oxford Street separates it from Soho and Mayfair, exclusive Regent Street marks its border with Fitzrovia, and cosmopolitan Edgware Road serves as its western edge. Within this enviably situated quarter are an array of outstanding restaurants (from Michelin darlings to down and dirty cheeseburgers), an impressive assortment of independently owned shops, and some of the city's quietest and most pleasant nooks, crannies and cobbled lanes.",

No amenities in the showers. All in all, the whole atmosphere, including the service, comes across as very monotonous and not very 2024 lifestyle-like. I think with a bit of creativity and willpower it could be freshened up relatively cheaply and quickly but in the meantime we won't be returning.",

You have to stay behind the ropes that span this one. However, 2 km further to the campsite you can swim in the lake casually. The water is pleasant , but the mud mush sticks well to your body . It also looks like white sand , but to me it looks more like white ground pebbles and it feels like that . If you go to the official entrance you pay 60 lira but you will be taken by electric transport to the lake and back. I was the only tourist on 05 /07/2024 . Rest assured :) to the campsite free",

It is therefore at the beginning of the Krutenau, whose etymology refers to places of market gardening on the outskirts of the towns. Originally inhabited by a rural community of wine-producers, market gardeners and boatmen, the Krutenau stretches out around the Turenne Street that the marshal took in 1674 for his triumphant entry in the city.

An easy way to see the rocks is from the Braille Trail, which was especially designed for people with visual and physical disabilities. The trail winds through the main area of rocks. An extension off the trail leads back to the ruins of an old railroad engine house, a remnant of the area’s quarrying and railroad history. Picnic tables are scattered among the trees and provide inviting spots to have a picnic lunch or rest and enjoy the interesting geologic formations found throughout the park.",

The art of flower arrangement as offerings of Vietnamese, used for buddhism, ancestor veneration and lunar festivities, have been around for hundreds of years. This beautiful tradition was disappearing in modern urban life, however, in 2020, a flower shop has revived the Hanoi spiritual flowers arrangements art and brought it to the new level. Comida Ngon uses creativity and a new artistic approach to rearrange the spiritual flowers, package them and sell them only. By joining these tours, tourists can learn about the spiritual lives of Vietnamese people, get to know the exotic fragrances of oriental flowers, and learn about aromas and sharps. Tourists can also learn how to arrange the flowers themself under the guidance of the local artists and interact with the florists. This is a beautiful exotic experience for all travelers visiting Hanoi",

There are several pit toilets within the campground which were very clean for being pit toilets. The hardstand bathrooms and showers were also very clean and well kept. They have a filtered water bottle refill station at the bathrooms too which was super nice. Right at the front of the family campsites is a small playground to give the kids something to do.There is a TON to do at this park. The trails are pretty kid friendly. One is paved, two are packed dirt. The Lime Kiln is the only one we didn't hike as it seemed to be a bit more advanced. Definitely check out the Indian Mounds. Such an amazing piece of history there. If you like geocaching, there are many caches in the park and most were a quick find with our kids.We saw a total of 3 playgrounds - in the campground, by the beach, and on the far side of the park by the observation tower.The beach - OK its mostly grass - was clean. There are a lot of shells close to the shore, but then it's clear, sandy bottom. You can swim way out there and still touch the bottom. These were the only bathroomsNow on to a list of pros and cons for camping...Pros: there are a ton of families. If you have kids, they'll make friends. Everyone congregated at the playground and had a blast.-People respect the quiet hours.-The camp host was friendly and helpful.-The entire campground is very, very well maintained. Every site is super well shaded.-Bugs were minimal in terms of mosquitos, even after the rain we just had (although I am writing this mid June, maybe we just got lucky because it's been fairly cold til now).-Also dog friendly, lots of doggos within the site (and people were cleaning up after them - yay).Cons: there are a ton of families. If kids aren't your jam, it may get annoying. We sat at the park with our kids, but there were a lot of unattended, screaming children. They quieted down around 9:30, but...I know thats not everyone's cup of tea.-There are also 4 legged friends 🦝 who paid us a visit and tried to get in our screen tent. I mean, it's a big park. There's going to be raccoons. It just wasn't pleasant to be awoken at 2 AM to them screeching 🤣 Keep your food locked up good.-If you're at the back of the campground, the trail runs RIGHT behind your campsite. Could be awkward. If you're at the front, you're by the playground.-Also, we got stuck by a large RV who couldn't back in to their site. Our site was a tight squeeze due to a tree in the middle of the driveway. The sites at the back seemed to be angled weird so this guy was really struggling. If you have a bigger trailer or RV, I'd consider a site in the middle of the grounds so you're not on a sharp curve trying to back in.Overall - Definitely a park we'll camp at again. I hope this was helpful!",

      "description": "My family visited this museum for the first time on a Monday afternoon. Based on the online reviews and information from the museum's website, I had certain expectations. However, after our visit, I found the experience to be just okay and felt it didn’t fully justify the $25 entrance fee.\n\nThe museum primarily features framed comic book covers from various comics around the world. There is also a revolving themed display, and during our visit, it showcased the history of Betty Boop. This display was quite interesting, with several authentic hand-painted animation cells on exhibit. Additionally, a small theater on the lower level played a continuous loop of Betty Boop movies, which was a nice touch.\n\nThat said, I was hoping for a greater variety of items on display beyond framed art and book covers.\n\nThe museum also has a small gift shop offering related merchandise.\n\nFor children and adults, there’s a scavenger hunt game where participants can earn a free poster by finding all the items on the list, which adds a fun interactive element.",

      "description": "Discovering Sumilon Island in Oslob is like stumbling upon a hidden gem in the heart of paradise. With just a quick 10-15 minute boat ride from the wharf, you're transported to a place of utter tranquility and natural splendor.\n\nFor the ultimate experience, I'd recommend starting your day with an early morning adventure, setting off around 7 am. Since there aren't any fancy amenities like cottages or tables on the island, it's best to come prepared with your own picnic essentials – a cozy blanket, some delicious snacks, and, of course, a commitment to keeping the island clean and pristine.\n\nSumilon is privately owned, and let me tell you, they know how to pamper their guests. You can opt for a luxurious overnight stay at their upscale hotel and resort or go for a day trip with options like Klook's day pass, which gives you access to exclusive perks like cottages, tables, and even a refreshing pool. But if you're on a budget, don't worry – you can still enjoy the island's beauty with public access, although you'll have to stick to certain areas.\n\nNavigating the island is a breeze with the help of local boat guides, especially when it comes to timing your visit. Trust me, you'll want to make the most of the cooler morning temperatures before the sun reaches its peak around 10 am. So don't forget to pack your essentials – a sturdy umbrella, a comfy chair, and, most importantly, plenty of sunscreen to keep you protected from the tropical rays.\n\nWhether you're starting your day with a dose of island magic or sneaking away for a peaceful mid-morning retreat, Sumilon Island promises an experience you won't soon forget. So come, lose yourself in its serene beauty, and let the coastal wonders of Oslob leave a lasting imprint on your soul.",
