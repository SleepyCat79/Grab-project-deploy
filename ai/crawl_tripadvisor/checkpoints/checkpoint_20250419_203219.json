Working hard, knowing how to take risks, natural instinct and sheer love of creating wonderful luxurious memories exceeding expectations were, and are our trademark. The challenging early days were made harder due to limited funds. Plus, our team was very young, trying hard to introduce a new concept into a competitive Spa market. But, our passion, open-minded approach, and unfailing determination paid off. Working 24/7 we laid LSG’s foundations and set a new trend for the Spa industry. Our goal is to consistently give every guest outstanding personal service from the heart focusing on sophistication, luxury.",

The support is really very pleasant.\nWhile drinking some tea, first fill out a small sheet of paper to describe your current state (tired, stressed, etc.)\nYou can choose to personalize your ritual etc. I think all of this can be done on the iPad when entering the cabin because once you have everything done, you will enter the cabin and confirm everything with my esthetician. described on the form. I see that this is duplicated. Then when it was time for the ceremony, I was left alone for an Ayurvedic massage. I loved my treatment, yen was very professional, very meticulous and she took the time to check that everything was going well during the treatment (temperature, massage pressure, zones) It's perfect! Thank you very much 🥰\nI will come back with great pleasure because this was a very good massage ritual, I will try other treatments, thank you again 🧘‍♀️ I really recommend!\"",

The short ride to the market was another small sightseeing experience for us! The market tour was interesting and we bought a few things there for our future use as well. We learned a lot of tips from Chef Hung (beyond foreign cookbooks), and we feel confident to remake the dishes back home. In fact, we plan to cook the dishes this coming weekend while our memory is fresh! ðŸ˜¹",

      "description": "It is 100km from Wuse2/central abuja. The Road is well tarred to gurara, aside a 3km stretch midway, which took 20mins to navigate. Total Journey time on powerbikes was 90mims to and 70mins back. Always quicker returning!!The PROSThe waterfall itself is an amazing tourist location and best enjoyed as a group. Pack ur own food and drinks as there isnt much at the location to feast upon. Danjuma the tour guide was brilliant. He was patient, knows the best spot for great pix, very helpful in helping u navigate the terrain and he takes excellent pix, if you hand him your phone/camera.The walking and dipping under the cascading waterfall lasted about two hours. Then another one hour recovering before riding back to abujaThere are several other things enroute that u may wish to stop for such as farmers market, Zuma rock (watch out for the monkeys that will pelt u with rocks if u tried climbing too high on to Zuma). A slight detour also takes you into the popular suleja market. So set off early. Its potentially a full day of activities.The CONS:If driving, check traffic updates very well before setting off.  Zuba and Madalla traffic was horrible the day we went due to road works.  Felt pity for those in cars. We rode, thankfully! The location is also poorly signed posted. Infact, the only signage was at the entrance (97km from our departure point). So if you dont have google map, u will have to keep asking.The guys at the gate also extort. They charged us N2k each as entrance fee, with no receipt issued. I guess Niger State govt dont need the revenue. Meant to be N500 apparently but having travelled that far, we had no choice. Still worth the 2k, if receipted!!",

      "description": "I booked this for a private event for 18 guests (male & female) on a Friday before my friend's wedding.  It was amazing!  I coordinated the private booking from the US via WhatsApp and used google translate to assist.  It was an easy process.  The coordinator was friendly and responsive to my questions given the time difference.  As a private party we had the facility to ourselves which included access to the indoor/outdoor thermal pools.  We organized various package services listed on the website and lunch served in the overlooking veranda (both based on each of the 18 people's specific service/drink package and lunch request which we provided in advance).  When we arrived, we were greeted and shown into the locker rooms for changing.  The facility was clean and had an attendant for the ladies room.  Robes & sandals were provided as well as secure lockers for the ladies. The bar staff was very attentive and quick to replenish our beverages.  The Thermal baths were wonderful.  The water was warm, clear, and clean.  The indoor thermals have an outside nook where the bar is located.  The grounds surrounding the facility had beautiful manicured landscaping & gardens around the outdoor pool and veranda.  There are lounge chairs available for sunbathing in the outdoor pool area.  We reserved the space for 6 hours (10am - 4pm).  They were able to accommodate the 17 people (one opted out of a massage and just enjoyed the thermals) who requested massages using 4 massage therapists in 2 rooms that can service 2 people at a time using a curtain divider.   The main course lunch options were Arrachera or Chicken breast with a salad appetizer and custard dessert.  All of which was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  I chose this location specifically because it does not allow children. This place is fantastic and I would absolutely book a private event with them again. I cannot recommend the Mayan Baths more highly!",

The concept of Now and Here conveys valuable messages about finding true happiness in simple things, by living in the “here and now”. “Inner peace is nowhere” can be reframed as “Inner peace is now here”. What a difference a blank space make! Nowhere Spa’s logo is the symbol for Mindfulness which visualizes the experience of being here and now. Vertical forms represent time - past and future while horizontal forms represent space - 360 degrees. And the one is always in the center - being here and now - perfect equanimity.",

Wedged between the northeastern corner of Hyde Park and the southern end of Regent's Park and with a number of Tube stations within easy reach, Marylebone is as pedestrian friendly as Central London gets. The bustling shopping mecca of Oxford Street separates it from Soho and Mayfair, exclusive Regent Street marks its border with Fitzrovia, and cosmopolitan Edgware Road serves as its western edge. Within this enviably situated quarter are an array of outstanding restaurants (from Michelin darlings to down and dirty cheeseburgers), an impressive assortment of independently owned shops, and some of the city's quietest and most pleasant nooks, crannies and cobbled lanes.",

He was always punctual, extremely kind, and incredibly accommodating. His deep knowledge of Zanzibar’s history, culture, and nature made each tour unique and special.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable and friendly guide who will help you discover the beauty of Zanzibar in a personal and relaxed way, we highly recommend Jaku.

No amenities in the showers. All in all, the whole atmosphere, including the service, comes across as very monotonous and not very 2024 lifestyle-like. I think with a bit of creativity and willpower it could be freshened up relatively cheaply and quickly but in the meantime we won't be returning.",

You have to stay behind the ropes that span this one. However, 2 km further to the campsite you can swim in the lake casually. The water is pleasant , but the mud mush sticks well to your body . It also looks like white sand , but to me it looks more like white ground pebbles and it feels like that . If you go to the official entrance you pay 60 lira but you will be taken by electric transport to the lake and back. I was the only tourist on 05 /07/2024 . Rest assured :) to the campsite free",

It took a walk of about 45 minutes, with stops to take photos, to reach the area with seals.",

      "description": "The « little Venice » is the name given to the course of the Lauch in Colmar. This name probably came from the original line of the houses on both sides of the river, which serves the southeast of the city. This district starts behind the Koïfhus, goes through the fishmonger's district and to the bridges Turenne and Saint-Pierre. It is therefore at the beginning of the Krutenau, whose etymology refers to places of market gardening on the outskirts of the towns. Originally inhabited by a rural community of wine-producers, market gardeners and boatmen, the Krutenau stretches out around the Turenne Street that the marshal took in 1674 for his triumphant entry in the city. Boat rides are possible there.",

Our chef will explain the produce and offer various samples along the way. After returning to the centre you will then participate in a 'hands-on' cooking class and the morning / afternoon finishes in our air-conditioned restaurant where you and your class mates can enjoy the dishes you have prepared along with free flow drinks. All guests receive a complimentary and much sort after Hanoi Cooking Centre apron and recipe cards. Class + lunch = approximately 3.5hrs For guests preferring a more adventurous time, our 5 hour street food tour also includes the market tour and then takes guests to 5 of the best known (amongst the locals and our HCC staff) street food venues across Hanoi.

The art of flower arrangement as offerings of Vietnamese, used for buddhism, ancestor veneration and lunar festivities, have been around for hundreds of years. This beautiful tradition was disappearing in modern urban life, however, in 2020, a flower shop has revived the Hanoi spiritual flowers arrangements art and brought it to the new level. Comida Ngon uses creativity and a new artistic approach to rearrange the spiritual flowers, package them and sell them only. By joining these tours, tourists can learn about the spiritual lives of Vietnamese people, get to know the exotic fragrances of oriental flowers, and learn about aromas and sharps. Tourists can also learn how to arrange the flowers themself under the guidance of the local artists and interact with the florists. This is a beautiful exotic experience for all travelers visiting Hanoi",

      "description": "We stayed for 2 nights in the family campground. Sites were well maintained and well shaded. There are several pit toilets within the campground which were very clean for being pit toilets. The hardstand bathrooms and showers were also very clean and well kept. They have a filtered water bottle refill station at the bathrooms too which was super nice. Right at the front of the family campsites is a small playground to give the kids something to do.There is a TON to do at this park. The trails are pretty kid friendly. One is paved, two are packed dirt. The Lime Kiln is the only one we didn't hike as it seemed to be a bit more advanced. Definitely check out the Indian Mounds. Such an amazing piece of history there. If you like geocaching, there are many caches in the park and most were a quick find with our kids.We saw a total of 3 playgrounds - in the campground, by the beach, and on the far side of the park by the observation tower.The beach - OK its mostly grass - was clean. There are a lot of shells close to the shore, but then it's clear, sandy bottom. You can swim way out there and still touch the bottom. These were the only bathroomsNow on to a list of pros and cons for camping...Pros: there are a ton of families. If you have kids, they'll make friends. Everyone congregated at the playground and had a blast.-People respect the quiet hours.-The camp host was friendly and helpful.-The entire campground is very, very well maintained. Every site is super well shaded.-Bugs were minimal in terms of mosquitos, even after the rain we just had (although I am writing this mid June, maybe we just got lucky because it's been fairly cold til now).-Also dog friendly, lots of doggos within the site (and people were cleaning up after them - yay).Cons: there are a ton of families. If kids aren't your jam, it may get annoying. We sat at the park with our kids, but there were a lot of unattended, screaming children. They quieted down around 9:30, but...I know thats not everyone's cup of tea.-There are also 4 legged friends 🦝 who paid us a visit and tried to get in our screen tent. I mean, it's a big park. There's going to be raccoons. It just wasn't pleasant to be awoken at 2 AM to them screeching 🤣 Keep your food locked up good.-If you're at the back of the campground, the trail runs RIGHT behind your campsite. Could be awkward. If you're at the front, you're by the playground.-Also, we got stuck by a large RV who couldn't back in to their site. Our site was a tight squeeze due to a tree in the middle of the driveway. The sites at the back seemed to be angled weird so this guy was really struggling. If you have a bigger trailer or RV, I'd consider a site in the middle of the grounds so you're not on a sharp curve trying to back in.Overall - Definitely a park we'll camp at again. I hope this was helpful!",

      "description": "My family visited this museum for the first time on a Monday afternoon. Based on the online reviews and information from the museum's website, I had certain expectations. However, after our visit, I found the experience to be just okay and felt it didn’t fully justify the $25 entrance fee.\n\nThe museum primarily features framed comic book covers from various comics around the world. There is also a revolving themed display, and during our visit, it showcased the history of Betty Boop. This display was quite interesting, with several authentic hand-painted animation cells on exhibit. Additionally, a small theater on the lower level played a continuous loop of Betty Boop movies, which was a nice touch.\n\nThat said, I was hoping for a greater variety of items on display beyond framed art and book covers.\n\nThe museum also has a small gift shop offering related merchandise.\n\nFor children and adults, there’s a scavenger hunt game where participants can earn a free poster by finding all the items on the list, which adds a fun interactive element.",

      "description": "Discovering Sumilon Island in Oslob is like stumbling upon a hidden gem in the heart of paradise. With just a quick 10-15 minute boat ride from the wharf, you're transported to a place of utter tranquility and natural splendor.\n\nFor the ultimate experience, I'd recommend starting your day with an early morning adventure, setting off around 7 am. Since there aren't any fancy amenities like cottages or tables on the island, it's best to come prepared with your own picnic essentials – a cozy blanket, some delicious snacks, and, of course, a commitment to keeping the island clean and pristine.\n\nSumilon is privately owned, and let me tell you, they know how to pamper their guests. You can opt for a luxurious overnight stay at their upscale hotel and resort or go for a day trip with options like Klook's day pass, which gives you access to exclusive perks like cottages, tables, and even a refreshing pool. But if you're on a budget, don't worry – you can still enjoy the island's beauty with public access, although you'll have to stick to certain areas.\n\nNavigating the island is a breeze with the help of local boat guides, especially when it comes to timing your visit. Trust me, you'll want to make the most of the cooler morning temperatures before the sun reaches its peak around 10 am. So don't forget to pack your essentials – a sturdy umbrella, a comfy chair, and, most importantly, plenty of sunscreen to keep you protected from the tropical rays.\n\nWhether you're starting your day with a dose of island magic or sneaking away for a peaceful mid-morning retreat, Sumilon Island promises an experience you won't soon forget. So come, lose yourself in its serene beauty, and let the coastal wonders of Oslob leave a lasting imprint on your soul.",

I found her a useless and annoying, harassing and rude presence. Especially because they are not real Masai, but little boys in disguise who know nothing about Masai culture or traditions. Unbearable and fake, their purpose would be to entertain you but they won't leave you a moment alone.",

The track climbs the mountainside, running through the forest, tunnels cut through the rock and over viaducts. You enter the realm of the high mountains, and round the last bend you’ll feel the magic: you’ve arrived at your destination at the foot of the famous Mer de Glace glacier, at an altitude of 1,913m.

Reading after the fact noticed they were all pre-covid.Got to an hour late with noone answering our phone calls, eventually a taxi shows up with our details. Took us to a petrol station and pointed at an old white van. We got in the van to find a guy sitting on a stool in the middle on the ground between the seats.Granted traffic was pretty bad, however we weren't even sure if they were going to show up.Eventually we get nearby to where we're going and we pull up next to another van and are told to get in that one. The transferred bus then took us to our destination.Noone spoke much English, which is okay, however some communication would have helped before hand, as we were fairly confused and about the multiple vehicle transfers along the trip.Van didn't look anything like shown in the photos inside and out.Seats were comfy though and we had room for our bags (van was full but noone else had any baggage)The driving was a bit all over the place, however seems fairly standard for navigating traffic on busy vietnam roads",

      "description": "Absolutely Disgraceful – Avoid This Company at All Costs!\n\nIf I could give zero stars, I would. Our experience with this company was an absolute nightmare from start to finish, and their treatment of my family has been nothing short of appalling.\n\nWe rented a camper from their Cairns branch in early January, expecting a smooth and enjoyable trip. Instead, we were handed a faulty, unsafe vehicle that was completely unfit for purpose. The bed was broken, the toilet was unusable, and critical fittings were missing or incorrectly installed. We had no choice but to sleep on the couch for multiple nights, despite my aunt being a recovering cancer patient. The stress and discomfort this caused her were completely unacceptable.\n\nWhen the bed first broke, we were forced to wait hours for a mechanic, missing an entire day of our holiday. The so-called “repair” lasted less than 48 hours before the bed broke again, leaving us stranded and forced to divert all the way to Brisbane—a destination that was never in our itinerary—to exchange the camper. Despite this massive inconvenience, we were still charged for tolls and fuel for the journey that was only necessary due to their faulty vehicle!\n\nTheir customer service was disgraceful—rude, dismissive, and unwilling to help. It took hours on the phone just to get basic assistance, and every step of the way, they refused to take responsibility. When we finally returned the camper early because the replacement was of lower quality and completely unsuitable, the Sydney branch supervisor was shocked at how we had been treated.\n\nNow, after weeks of back-and-forth emails, the company is refusing to pay us the compensation we are legally entitled to. Instead, they have told us to take them to court if we want to recover our costs. This company ruined a once-in-a-lifetime trip for my family, and their refusal to provide any real remedy under Australian Consumer Law is disgusting.\n\nDo yourself a favor—DO NOT book with this company. Their vehicles are unsafe, their service is atrocious, and they will leave you stranded and out of pocket rather than take responsibility for their failures. Spend your money elsewhere and avoid this scam of a business!",

      "description": "We visited the Námafjall Hverir area as we arrived into the Myvatn area from the east and this was one of the first areas you arrive at. Needless to say, you can smell this place before you see it - especially if you have the car vents on! Being an area of strong geothermal activity the smell of sulphur is strong...very strong! It could possibly be a bit overbearing if you're not great with potent smells or have a dodgy stomach. \n\nThe area itself is very interesting, having paid for parking we headed over to the boiling mud pools and to admire the incredibly colourful landscape. If you've seen geothermal mud pits before its likely to be just a good place to stretch your legs as opposed to fascinating but either way its definitely worth a stop. The parking was 1200Kr for the day so it isn't going to break the bank however there are no facilities there so its quite limited how long you'd actually want to spend. It was quite interesting that this was more expensive to park at than any of the other local sights around it -  not sure of the justification for that but there you go.\n\n!!!HUGE TIP!!!\nWear boots as the paths are very muddy and sulphur rich so its bright yellow mud! We seen plenty of people wearing what were supposed to be bright white Nike trainers - they didn't last long! It would be great if there was a tap and a boot brush that could be used in the car park but alas we thankfully had some hand wipes in the car to clean off the excess we couldn't shake off.",

The sharks were at chest depth.. js..Lots of fishermen, so that draws them in. Just be aware of your surroundings",

We found sweatshirts and caps sufficient for the quite cool mid-October weather, but the weather was clear.  It was bigger than I had expected, but not overly long for being out at night. I do not care for typical Halloween activities such as haunted houses and spook alleys, but found this very upbeat and cheery, not scarey.

Our approach is “anthropological”- we believe that the value and appreciation of an object is increased when we know what it is , when and why it was made and who made it, who used it, why it looks the way it does. We have over 1000 objects on display and objects from our collection have been exhibited in national museums in Hanoi. All objects are guaranteed to be as described and accompanied by a Fact Sheet of at least 1000 words, giving the details on the people who made the object, materials used, purpose, and probable age. We work with numerous museums in VN, USA, and elsewhere. Our price range is very broad, with objects under $20 and over $1000.",

We will introduce you an unique area of Halong Bay from its back where you rarely see any tourist boat. We especially customize this route for you to explore the hidden area of Cat Ba Island and Lan Ha Bay – the additional parts of the Wonder of Halong Bay and the World Biosphere reserved area. By this tour itinerary, we believe that we will satisfy customers who dislike crowded tourist attractions and those who have passion for discovering.",

You pay admission from 7.30 pm you arrive at 7.20 pm despite no one putting you on hold , they start working the reservation at 7.35 pm, so you arrive at 7.45 pm in the changing rooms and at cca 20, if you manage quickly the locker find, arrange maze style. \nAt 22.20 they kick you out closing the tanks and opening all the doors to the outside, despite January and all still on the various returns.\nSo : you go in at 8:00 pm cca you go out at 10:20 pm , 1 hour cca you pay for nothing . And then if we book the same day you no longer have the discount for relaxation offer under the stars, but you pay full price 58 euros per head....\nWhat about...\nEveryone throws fire on his pot, but so maybe it's a bit exaggerated....",

      "description": "My husband (71, good health) and I (65, bad hips, broke knee in August) embarked on our first Potosina adventure with trepidation, but we ended up loving it.After a delicious breakfast at Kapul (restaurant across the street from our hotel, highly recommended), our guide, Carlos of Diversion Huasteca, met us at our hotel in Ciudad Valle (Casa Ortiz, also highly recommended).Carlos then drove us and another family (mother with 3 grown sons) about an hour to the Tamul Waterfall for our first day in the Huasteca Potosina. We stopped on the way to pick up water shoes (indispensable - I hated them and thought I could do the whole thing barefoot or in my flipflops and I was SO glad I listened to Carlos), a waterproof cellphone case and a snack.We parked on the highway then hiked down a beautiful rolling hillside (fairly flat, a few stairs) about 1km to the unbelievable river, where our panga awaited us, with our boatman Jume. We donned lifejackets and grabbed our paddles, then headed upriver, a 4km trip against a slight current in absolutely spectacularly aquamarine blue water.I am an experienced kayaker and had no trouble with the paddle, but if I had, the others could have easily picked up the slack as it was not arduous. Our boatman pulled the panga over the portage mid-trip, and we walked along a track on the river about 400m. It was an easy and beautiful walk, then we canoed the rest of the way to the falls.On the way, we canoed under a low cascade that was both refreshing and exhilarating. It really felt like an adventure, as the water roared down, the mosses glistened and the maidenhair ferns waved at us through the spray.We didn't get that close to the falls themselves as the current was too strong, but we all clambered up a rock so Carlos could take our photo, with the cascade as a backdrop.We passed a number of other pangas going and coming, and in each case we splashed each other ferociously. Very cool - literally and figuratively. So there were other tourists there, but it didn't feel crowded, and there were plenty of stretches of river where it was just us and the cliffs on either side of use - and one small crocodile sunning himself, a bunch of muddy turtles, and lots of different kinds of birds.Heading back, we stopped just above the smaller waterfall and climbed up some stairs (about 30) to the spring in a cave where the small waterfall begins. The cave was full of stalactites and the rocks at the entrance were smoothly coated with the limestone sediment, so getting in was easy. I swam to the back of the cave (tricky in my lifejacket, but they are required) about 20m.Then we walked down the stairs and played in the pools created at the top of the falls in the limestone, with outcroppings of rock crowned by tufts of green - ferns, moss, trees, vines - making the rushing waters eddy and foam and whirl. It was like a fantastic outdoor jacuzzi.We finished our trip back where we started, and though the walk back to the car seemed longer than the trip going (and my shoulder was a bit stiff), we collapsed happily for the drive to lunch.Then Carlos drove us a short was to a restaurant on a fish hatchery pond. My husband and I split bagre zarandeado (catfish grilled with a non-spicy chili marinade), which was delicious, and cold Topochico with lime. So refreshing and we were SOO hungry!Sleep and replete, Carlos drove us all back to our hotels, ready for the next day of our Potosina adventure.",

Mind you , this is perhaps New Jersey's finest , most well p[reserved 18th-19th century historic site ! ........

This was one of the best massages of my life!\n\nI was lucky to get a 2-hour Thai massage from Nuree (I wish I had written her name down), who was incredibly professional. She adjusted her pressure based on my breathing and used her forearms and elbows with expert precision.\n\nI opted for the 2-hour massage with oil, which can sometimes feel routine, but in Nuree’s hands, it was magical. The oil had a Tiger Balm-like quality that complemented the massage perfectly.\n\nMassage Tip: Go in the morning! They get busy in the afternoon, but after the initial rush, it slows down. I arrived at 10 AM and had the place to myself by 11. Highly recommend this experience!",

Singer/ server did a nice job too!! The rain and clouds were gone so there was a beautiful sunset over the River!! We did walk outside and up to the top to see from there. Very chilly!! Didn’t stay outside for long!!We would have liked a little information about what we were seeing once in awhile while traveling on the river. We enjoyed the 2 hours on the Old Steam Paddle Boat.",

From the moment we met him, Thomas was incredibly nice and friendly, making everyone in our group feel welcome. He was a wealth of information, patiently answering all our questions and sharing fascinating insights about the canyon's history, the surrounding nature, and the rich Navajo culture. What really stood out was how Thomas helped us capture the beauty of the canyon ourselves – he took some great photos of our family and even shared his tips and tricks for getting amazing shots with our own cameras. Plus, he was a very skilled driver navigating the sandy desert roads! Thomas was patient, had a great sense of humor, and his knowledge truly enhanced our visit. The meeting spot for the tour was also easy to find, which made the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. I highly recommend taking a tour with Antelope Canyon Navajo Tours and if you can, ask for Thomas H. – he made our visit truly memorable!",
