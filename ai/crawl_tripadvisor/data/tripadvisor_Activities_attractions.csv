You need to take your time and explore slowly.  Visit at different times, early morning in the calm, the chaos of the day and then the nighttime activities | Old Quarter comes to life after 6pm especially near Hang Bac, Ta Hien street and 'Beer corner' virtually everywhere it is either a bar or a restaurant, often spilling out into the road, car drivers often at a standstill as a result of the crowds and tables.Food is excellent and abundant, our favourite was the Bar-b-que for two, (three, four) people, cooked on a slow heated dish in front of you coupled with a couple of beers, excellent! all at stupid prices, so incredibly cheap! | I chose a private half-day tour of the Old Quarter, where the guide highlights key sites like the pagoda in the lake, the prison, and the French Quarter. You can also enjoy tasty local Vietnamese food with the guide's help in choosing. I strongly recommend having a guide, as they are very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d317503-Reviews-Old_Quarter-Hanoi.html,/TransparencyReport2025
