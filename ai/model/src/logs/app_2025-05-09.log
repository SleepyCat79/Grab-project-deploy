Service is exceptional with a feeling of being well-looked after by your server, and provides a very welcoming and hospitable atmosphere throughout your stay. The quality of food is also excellent and everything is fresh; we ordered summer spring rolls with bun cha and beef in bamboo which were all cooked to perfection. The service also continued here with a concise demonstration on eating practices from your server. The relative medium-high price (compared to UK and other western countries) are very much worth it as you the quality of the food, service and atmosphere fully justify what you will pay. A great way to end our stay in Vietnam!, This may be the most expensive meal in this trip to Vietnam, but it is only about 100 RMB per person. The restaurant is on the upper floor of a hotel, and you need to walk up from the 7th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is very distinctive. I ordered the special Bun Cha, which is charcoal grilled pork, served with basil and rice noodles. The pork is very tender and slightly chewy, and it is very delicious with the sauce. The lotus root salad is very refreshing, with a lot of shrimp and boiled pork. I also greedily ordered mushroom spring rolls, which are a bit average. In addition to seafood mushrooms and vegetables, there are also rice noodles, which are too filling. The dipping sauce is a bit too salty. The service of a high-end restaurant, the waiter Scott will introduce each dish. At the end, the restaurant gave chopsticks as a gift., Very interesting dishes. Surprising and delicious. I recommend ordering the main dish “Bun Cha”. Dishes are well served and reasonably priced. We were especially taken care of by Hieu Nguyen, who was very attentive and helpful.

Couldn’t fault the service, speed, menu or anything else. Love that they had clearly marked out “not spicy” on some options too! Juices were delicious also., 😊 I was surprised when I was back this time. The restaurant has a new menu with more food options- adding more Western vegan food. 😗 If you eat there at night on weekends, you"ll have free live music from other pubs nearby. On weekdays, it"s quite peaceful. The price now is up though the food portion is still same. Like last time the Vietnamese noodles would be 50 or 55k, but now it"s 65k. 🙂 The drink menu seems better and very friendly healthy drinks. 🤦\u200d♀️ It"s still an inconvenience when the staff is only on 1st and 3rd floor whereas the customers on the 2nd floor want to ask for something like sauce, new order.

The young man that served us ( wish I had gotten his name ) was absolutely outstanding as far as explaining the Restuarant and menu to us thank you so much young man.

Everything looked so great, the decoration, the light, and the bubbles while kids were arriving, made it extra special. Kids had the best time, and we could be relaxed, because they were taking care of everything. We were in their hands, and we appreciate it. We highly recommend this place, I think it is the best for kids and parents. We were impressed since the first time we visited, and we still are, always in our hearts ❤️, This is a great place to visit if you have small children under 10. There different play areas, each themed plus a ball pit with screen. For little girls there is an abundance of princess dresses to wear. Whilst your little ones are playing parents can relax with a wide variety of drinks. I recommend the Coconut Coffee, the best we had on our visit to Hanoi. If the family gets hungry, there is a wide variety of dishes. Cleanliness is a very high priority ., Two things that stand out about the place: nice and friendly staff and clean and child-friendly playhouse. I am so happy we picked Lalina for our boy"s birthday party venue. The owner himself was hands-on, his staff were all very friendly and accommodating. They did all they could to cater to our request, especially the environment-friendly decorations. They were very helpful and made sure everyone was catered to. Food was great!

Impressive classy hotel foyer… restaurant has white table clothed tables.. Impressive comfy chairs..and expected classy fit out! It was a “ table buffet”..where U order a Yum Cha dish ,and it is brought to the table..next dish ordered, and the process continues. Order n eat!! Then, I turned over the menu, to discover Cantonese Roast Duck, and a couple of “ side dishes”. We were almost finished when discovering the back page .. so ordered a Roast Duck dish…!!! At first sight, it would have to be the best looking 1/4 Roast Duck, that I have seen to date.( and Cantonese Roast Duck, is my favourite dish !!! Looked absolutely “ perfect colour wise”..but lacked the flavour marinade , that is the epitome of Cantonese Roast Duck! Rate 4/10 The Yum Cha menu, is Very good, basic.(cf HK) no offal or deep fried taro , or savoury dumplings, etc, etc.. but what was available was 7.5/10. The service was a let down.. 3 staff for 5 tables ( 4..5.. and 3x2 diners) They were too occupied doing nothing, and had to virtually shout, to get their attention.. my arm was sore staying up! 3/10..a disgrace !!!, Mongolian food is, shall we say, interesting. It is a little bit Chinese and a little bit Russian and a little bit mutton and potatoes oriented. But here, at Silk Road, we were served a three course lunch (salad, soup, and main) that was a lovely blend of all of the above. It was such a pleasant luncheon and delicious too. The meat wasn"t fatty or tough. The soup wasn"t too salty. It was quiet inside, and well decorated, and the wait staff was intent on doing their jobs.

The restaurant is on the upper floor of a hotel, and you need to walk up from the 7th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is very distinctive. I ordered the special Bun Cha, which is charcoal grilled pork, served with basil and rice noodles. The pork is very tender and slightly chewy, and it is very delicious with the sauce. The lotus root salad is very refreshing, with a lot of shrimp and boiled pork. I also greedily ordered mushroom spring rolls, which are a bit average. In addition to seafood mushrooms and vegetables, there are also rice noodles, which are too filling. The dipping sauce is a bit too salty. The service of a high-end restaurant, the waiter Scott will introduce each dish. At the end, the restaurant gave chopsticks as a gift., Very interesting dishes. Surprising and delicious.

Impressive classy hotel foyer… restaurant has white table clothed tables.. Impressive comfy chairs..and expected classy fit out! It was a “ table buffet”..where U order a Yum Cha dish ,and it is brought to the table..next dish ordered, and the process continues. Order n eat!! Then, I turned over the menu, to discover Cantonese Roast Duck, and a couple of “ side dishes”. We were almost finished when discovering the back page .. so ordered a Roast Duck dish…!!! At first sight, it would have to be the best looking 1/4 Roast Duck, that I have seen to date.( and Cantonese Roast Duck, is my favourite dish !!! Looked absolutely “ perfect colour wise”..but lacked the flavour marinade , that is the epitome of Cantonese Roast Duck! Rate 4/10 The Yum Cha menu, is Very good, basic.(cf HK) no offal or deep fried taro , or savoury dumplings, etc, etc.. but what was available was 7.5/10. The service was a let down.. 3 staff for 5 tables ( 4..5.. and 3x2 diners) They were too occupied doing nothing, and had to virtually shout, to get their attention.. my arm was sore staying up! 3/10..a disgrace !!!, Mongolian food is, shall we say, interesting. It is a little bit Chinese and a little bit Russian and a little bit mutton and potatoes oriented. But here, at Silk Road, we were served a three course lunch (salad, soup, and main) that was a lovely blend of all of the above. It was such a pleasant luncheon and delicious too. The meat wasn"t fatty or tough. The soup wasn"t too salty. It was quiet inside, and well decorated, and the wait staff was intent on doing their jobs.

We ended up waiting 30 min to get our drinks even though the restaurant were not that busy ( + the drinks was overpriced compared to size and quality). When we wanted to pay the bill, we waited over 15 min after talking to a waiter before they came with the bill. Overall bad service., Thought I’d have my last evening meal in Hue on the Son Hương. I’d had a daytime beer to escape the heat on it a few days ago & the menu looked decent enough. I couldn’t fault the ambience but the food & service was very disappointing to say the least. I was advised that my choice would take 35 minutes but it turned up 10 minutes later & was cold. I already had my table placing whipped away from me prior to my meal being served & when I complained about the meal I was met with a half hearted apology.

We asked for another room and were brought to an ornate room on the 9th floor that had 5 out of 6 tables filled. The table and chairs (with cushions) looked very Chinese but were Vietnamese (and very heavy with very straight backs). The menu that we had found on facebook actually existed so we were able to order the dishes we had identified. We ordered a lime juice (VND 75,000) and water and were brought a bowl of pretty good peanuts and very good pickled celery. Our first dish was a crab and scallop soup (VND 165,000) which was good and had tasty pieces of crab and scallop in it. The next dish to arrive was the sticky rice (VND 75,000) which were a delightful surprise. Very light puffs of sticky rice that were also tasty. We were getting to like this restaurant. The salad with young coconut, shrimp and pork belly (VND 175,000) was very good and flavorful. The last dish to arrive was the hemibagrus fish (VND 295,000) made with galangal was delicious and served with an excellent sauce. That fish is a type of catfish and was tender and juicy. Our sever spoke good English and was very efficient. The general manager stopped by our table a couple of times and later sat with us. He told us we were in the VIP room and that one table had Vietnamese government people and another had tourists. He said his customers were about half Vietnamese. He recommended a restaurant to us that he thought we’d like and told us about his family. It was great fun. We had delightful evening and excellent food. We spent VND 1,271,600 US $52.93., This must be the most exquisite Vietnamese restaurant I"ve ever seen or visited. The entry takes your breath, the 9 different floors are so spectacular. The food, I cannot express how magnificent the food is, elegant and sophisticated, lite, but with a punch. The Pineapple rice came in half pineapple, the colours, flovour and taste lit up our faces. The pigeon, rice paper wraps, beef in coconut all blew our minds., The kind staff and elegance of the service are of global quality, so much so that I have to say it is simply the best Asian restaurant I"ve ever been to. Magnificent!!!, The restaurant not only boasts good food, it is also filled with historical artefacts worth millions of dollars. Spectacular and really eye-opening. Go to the roof top for a great view before you dine. Spread over eight floors, the fare is mostly Vietnamese and these were deliciously excellent. Managed by a young man, the restaurant is a must-visit for all visitors to Hanoi. The service staff was very well-trained and attentive. The 17 of us had plenty of great food washed down with three bottles of whiskey and four bottles of wine. We were left overwhelmed by the food and ambience. It is a fantastic experience and all agreed that they would come back when they next visit Hanoi. What an evening, thank you Com Viet.

The unanimous experience was that they had been much better pampered in smaller restaurants. Not only were some orders forgotten, but the service was otherwise characterized by a lack of attention. Not a plus for us, but it should be noted that the portions are (too???) large and the prices are very moderate. We all ordered different dishes, none of which were a real highlight, but none of which were completely unsatisfactory either. As can be read from other reviews, it remains completely unclear how the Michelin * that is advertised can be justified (if it really is one)., We ordered 5 dishes- 2 were delicious, 2 were average and the veal with lemongrass and chilli dish was terrible. The veal had a lot of hard fat on it which made the dish inedible. We showed the waitress the fat but she said she was unable to exchange it or take it off the bill as we had tried it. Not a dish that you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. Overpriced and overrated., This was highly recommended, and you do need to make a reservation. I wasn’t particularly impressed from start to end. Service was not attentive; items were slow to come and needed reminders. Maybe they were busy, but there definitely isn’t a shortage of staff. Food was above average. The fried prawn with star fruit sounds cute, but the tiny prawns could have been deshelled. Crab meat soup was ultra-bland. The caramelised egg and braised pork belly in Claypot was excellent. Roast chicken was the other saving grace, but its presentation can be improved. In fact all the dishes’ presentation can do better. We’ve seen significantly higher standards in taste and presentation in multiple other restaurants in Hanoi. They have many offerings, but not many that jump out of the page. Won’t recommend to my friends, sorry.

Impressive classy hotel foyer… restaurant has white table clothed tables.. Impressive comfy chairs..and expected classy fit out!

Then, I turned over the menu, to discover Cantonese Roast Duck, and a couple of “ side dishes”. We were almost finished when discovering the back page .. so ordered a Roast Duck dish…!!! At first sight, it would have to be the best looking 1/4 Roast Duck, that I have seen to date.( and Cantonese Roast Duck, is my favourite dish !!! Looked absolutely “ perfect colour wise”..but lacked the flavour marinade , that is the epitome of Cantonese Roast Duck! Rate 4/10 The Yum Cha menu, is Very good, basic.(cf HK) no offal or deep fried taro , or savoury dumplings, etc, etc.. but what was available was 7.5/10. The service was a let down.. 3 staff for 5 tables ( 4..5.. and 3x2 diners) They were too occupied doing nothing, and had to virtually shout, to get their attention.. my arm was sore staying up! 3/10..a disgrace !!!, Mongolian food is, shall we say, interesting. It is a little bit Chinese and a little bit Russian and a little bit mutton and potatoes oriented. But here, at Silk Road, we were served a three course lunch (salad, soup, and main) that was a lovely blend of all of the above. It was such a pleasant luncheon and delicious too. The meat wasn"t fatty or tough. The soup wasn"t too salty. It was quiet inside, and well decorated, and the wait staff was intent on doing their jobs.

Service is exceptional with a feeling of being well-looked after by your server, and provides a very welcoming and hospitable atmosphere throughout your stay. The quality of food is also excellent and everything is fresh; we ordered summer spring rolls with bun cha and beef in bamboo which were all cooked to perfection. The service also continued here with a concise demonstration on eating practices from your server. The relative medium-high price (compared to UK and other western countries) are very much worth it as you the quality of the food, service and atmosphere fully justify what you will pay. A great way to end our stay in Vietnam!, This may be the most expensive meal in this trip to Vietnam, but it is only about 100 RMB per person. The restaurant is on the upper floor of a hotel, and you need to walk up from the 7th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is very distinctive. I ordered the special Bun Cha, which is charcoal grilled pork, served with basil and rice noodles. The pork is very tender and slightly chewy, and it is very delicious with the sauce. The lotus root salad is very refreshing, with a lot of shrimp and boiled pork. I also greedily ordered mushroom spring rolls, which are a bit average. In addition to seafood mushrooms and vegetables, there are also rice noodles, which are too filling. The dipping sauce is a bit too salty. The service of a high-end restaurant, the waiter Scott will introduce each dish. At the end, the restaurant gave chopsticks as a gift., Very interesting dishes. Surprising and delicious. I recommend ordering the main dish “Bun Cha”. Dishes are well served and reasonably priced. We were especially taken care of by Hieu Nguyen, who was very attentive and helpful.

After a round trip in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and a lot of restaurant visits, we can say afterwards that we ate very well there. The fried spring rolls with seafood were particularly recommended. I hadn"t eaten any better on the whole trip. On our second visit we had found that you can not only sit downstairs, but there is still a very nice dining room on the first floor, to which a balcony is connected. Sitting there facing the hustle and bustle of the street, with delicious food and a cool local beer, is a pleasure. Rounding off the visit does the very good and very friendly service., Our tour guide took us here for lunch on our first day in Hanoi. Others had a set menu but 6 of us just ordered what we wanted. The waiter ensured that the 3 couples were billed separately which was greatly appreciated. Most of the staff could speak English well enough for us to communicate easily. The food was delicious and there was a good variety of drinks available. Credit card were accepted which made it very convenient.

Service is exceptional with a feeling of being well-looked after by your server, and provides a very welcoming and hospitable atmosphere throughout your stay. The quality of food is also excellent and everything is fresh; we ordered summer spring rolls with bun cha and beef in bamboo which were all cooked to perfection. The service also continued here with a concise demonstration on eating practices from your server. The relative medium-high price (compared to UK and other western countries) are very much worth it as you the quality of the food, service and atmosphere fully justify what you will pay. A great way to end our stay in Vietnam!, This may be the most expensive meal in this trip to Vietnam, but it is only about 100 RMB per person. The restaurant is on the upper floor of a hotel, and you need to walk up from the 7th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is very distinctive. I ordered the special Bun Cha, which is charcoal grilled pork, served with basil and rice noodles. The pork is very tender and slightly chewy, and it is very delicious with the sauce. The lotus root salad is very refreshing, with a lot of shrimp and boiled pork. I also greedily ordered mushroom spring rolls, which are a bit average. In addition to seafood mushrooms and vegetables, there are also rice noodles, which are too filling. The dipping sauce is a bit too salty. The service of a high-end restaurant, the waiter Scott will introduce each dish. At the end, the restaurant gave chopsticks as a gift., Very interesting dishes. Surprising and delicious. I recommend ordering the main dish “Bun Cha”. Dishes are well served and reasonably priced. We were especially taken care of by Hieu Nguyen, who was very attentive and helpful.

The waiters are really friendly and helpful, the food is excellent and you can see that there is a research to mix traditional vietnamese food with new ways of cooking and presenting it. It is the perfect spot to conclude a long sightseeing day in Hanoi., The restaurant Vi Hanoi I can fully recommend. After a round trip in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and a lot of restaurant visits, we can say afterwards that we ate very well there. The fried spring rolls with seafood were particularly recommended. I hadn"t eaten any better on the whole trip. On our second visit we had found that you can not only sit downstairs, but there is still a very nice dining room on the first floor, to which a balcony is connected. Sitting there facing the hustle and bustle of the street, with delicious food and a cool local beer, is a pleasure. Rounding off the visit does the very good and very friendly service., Our tour guide took us here for lunch on our first day in Hanoi. Others had a set menu but 6 of us just ordered what we wanted. The waiter ensured that the 3 couples were billed separately which was greatly appreciated. Most of the staff could speak English well enough for us to communicate easily. The food was delicious and there was a good variety of drinks available. Credit card were accepted which made it very convenient. We were so impressed 4 of us caught a taxi to have dinner there again on our last night. Once again the meal and service were excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant.

Still a very nice and peaceful place as before. We ordered a basket of pastries but not really impressed with it given the standard of Sofitel Metropole, I would expect more delicious pastries rather the one had (it could score 7/10 if you compare with authentic French pastries). Beverages were ok as we went for mixed juices and coffee and water. The only disappointing that I should highlight here is that Sofitel Metropole no longer provides printed newspapers like The New York Times or Vietnam News to read anymore and you would have to read on your small screen via PressReader which was unpleasant experience. Ans I hope that Metropole would think again about setting out a few copies at its restaurants and bars., Under the rattan ceiling fans inside the Bamboo Bar pavilion in the Metropole courtyard or at poolside, a relaxed lunch, brunch, or snack with drinks would be in order. The French onion soup is a must, and a Charlie Chaplain cocktail is a must. We were joined by two other couples and each of us had favorites from the can"t-miss menu., Although we did not stay at the Sofitel, we were curious to visit this iconic hotel so we went twice for lunch to the bamboo bar. Service is very upmarket and the personnel is kind and friendly. I can highly recommend the salade niçoise and the beef pho. Beautifully presented and both delicious. On our second visit, we ordered burgers and got the wrong ones. They offered to replace them, but we decided to eat the ones we had been served which were a bit bland, so they probably needed the foie gras or cheese to be more tasty. Our coffee was then offered in compensation which was a classy gesture.

Impressive classy hotel foyer… restaurant has white table clothed tables.. Impressive comfy chairs..and expected classy fit out! It was a “ table buffet”..where U order a Yum Cha dish ,and it is brought to the table..next dish ordered, and the process continues. Order n eat!! Then, I turned over the menu, to discover Cantonese Roast Duck, and a couple of “ side dishes”. We were almost finished when discovering the back page .. so ordered a Roast Duck dish…!!! At first sight, it would have to be the best looking 1/4 Roast Duck, that I have seen to date.( and Cantonese Roast Duck, is my favourite dish !!! Looked absolutely “ perfect colour wise”..but lacked the flavour marinade , that is the epitome of Cantonese Roast Duck! Rate 4/10 The Yum Cha menu, is Very good, basic.(cf HK) no offal or deep fried taro , or savoury dumplings, etc, etc.. but what was available was 7.5/10. The service was a let down.. 3 staff for 5 tables ( 4..5.. and 3x2 diners) They were too occupied doing nothing, and had to virtually shout, to get their attention.. my arm was sore staying up! 3/10..a disgrace !!!, Mongolian food is, shall we say, interesting. It is a little bit Chinese and a little bit Russian and a little bit mutton and potatoes oriented. But here, at Silk Road, we were served a three course lunch (salad, soup, and main) that was a lovely blend of all of the above. It was such a pleasant luncheon and delicious too. The meat wasn"t fatty or tough. The soup wasn"t too salty. It was quiet inside, and well decorated, and the wait staff was intent on doing their jobs. It was a lovely lunch!, Dimsum was great, around 250.000vnd for a set, they have set A and B, only available for lunch!
