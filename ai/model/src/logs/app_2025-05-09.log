Service is exceptional with a feeling of being well-looked after by your server, and provides a very welcoming and hospitable atmosphere throughout your stay. The quality of food is also excellent and everything is fresh; we ordered summer spring rolls with bun cha and beef in bamboo which were all cooked to perfection. The service also continued here with a concise demonstration on eating practices from your server. The relative medium-high price (compared to UK and other western countries) are very much worth it as you the quality of the food, service and atmosphere fully justify what you will pay. A great way to end our stay in Vietnam!, This may be the most expensive meal in this trip to Vietnam, but it is only about 100 RMB per person. The restaurant is on the upper floor of a hotel, and you need to walk up from the 7th floor. The decoration of the restaurant is very distinctive. I ordered the special Bun Cha, which is charcoal grilled pork, served with basil and rice noodles. The pork is very tender and slightly chewy, and it is very delicious with the sauce. The lotus root salad is very refreshing, with a lot of shrimp and boiled pork. I also greedily ordered mushroom spring rolls, which are a bit average. In addition to seafood mushrooms and vegetables, there are also rice noodles, which are too filling. The dipping sauce is a bit too salty. The service of a high-end restaurant, the waiter Scott will introduce each dish. At the end, the restaurant gave chopsticks as a gift., Very interesting dishes. Surprising and delicious. I recommend ordering the main dish “Bun Cha”. Dishes are well served and reasonably priced. We were especially taken care of by Hieu Nguyen, who was very attentive and helpful.

Food was delicious - we tried the banana pancakes, vegan oatmeal, Hanoi rolls and stuffed tofu. Portions were extremely generous and we struggled to finish (but did so because it was so yummy!) Couldn’t fault the service, speed, menu or anything else. Love that they had clearly marked out “not spicy” on some options too! Juices were delicious also., 😊 I was surprised when I was back this time. The restaurant has a new menu with more food options- adding more Western vegan food. 😗 If you eat there at night on weekends, you"ll have free live music from other pubs nearby. On weekdays, it"s quite peaceful. The price now is up though the food portion is still same. Like last time the Vietnamese noodles would be 50 or 55k, but now it"s 65k. 🙂 The drink menu seems better and very friendly healthy drinks. 🤦\u200d♀️ It"s still an inconvenience when the staff is only on 1st and 3rd floor whereas the customers on the 2nd floor want to ask for something like sauce, new order.

The restaurant offers a large selection and the food tasted good. The service was good and quick. The only disadvantage is that the restaurant charges a surcharge for credit card payments. Otherwise, it is certainly a good choice for a meal., We had 3 dishes (prawn rolls, papaya salad and the traditional bun chq and it was enough for 2 people. We enjoyed the food that much we even came back to do a cooking class! They let us choose 4 dishes and took us to the market for the ingredients, it was enjoyable and fun.

The best part was that the owner helped choose our food and she picked items partly based on the weather! Everything was excellent and I’d come back again. Our only disappointment was we found out they give egg coffee making lessons but unfortunately it was our last day so we had no time for egg coffee learning :(. Next time we visit!!!, Found this little Restuarant by mistake and what a little beauty. The young man that served us ( wish I had gotten his name ) was absolutely outstanding as far as explaining the Restuarant and menu to us thank you so much young man. We dropped in for lunch and ordered the smoked pork belly, duck spring rolls and mango chicken salad. Yum, Yum Yum. Loved it so much we are going back tonight for dinner and a bottle of wine. If you are ever in Hanoi and around the old quarters don’t go past this place you won’t be disappointed., Fantastic cafe, brilliant coffee and food. You can sit inside with A/C or in their private garden The staff speak great English and are proud of the food they make. I’d highly recommend the duck Pho.
